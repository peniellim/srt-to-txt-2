1
Will you two slow down?

2
You're eating like
they're going to take it away from you.

3
I'm a growing girl.

4
It's such a pleasure seeing you
and seeing how well work is going.

5
Work's going really well, yeah.

6
My boss said that he wants to see my book

7
when it's done, which is really exciting.

8
Where are you at with that?

9
Oh, well, I've done four of the essays,

10
and I'm just kind of polishing them up.

11
And my hope is that it's going to be nine.

12
But, you know, it's a memoir.
So, have to live them first.

13
Tad, I don't want to just leave it
'til the end of dinner.

14
I hear that.

15
Hannah, your mother
and I have been talking,

16
and we feel that it may be time...

17
how can I phrase this?

18
Well, we see how well
you're doing at work.

19
And you really seem to be
figuring out what it is that you want.

20
But it may be time for one final push.

21
What is a "final push"?

22
We're not going to be
supporting you any longer.

23
You see, I wasn't going to
phrase it like that, Doreen,

24
-the way you phrased it.
-But I have no job.

25
No, you have an internship
that you say is going to turn into a job.

26
I don't know when.

27
You graduated from college two years ago.

28
We've been supporting you
for two years, and that's enough.

29
Do you know how crazy
the economy is right now?

30
I mean, all my friends
get help from their parents.

31
We are sympathetic to that.

32
But I'm your only child.

33
It's not like I'm draining
all your resources.

34
I mean, this feels very arbitrary.

35
You don't know anything
about our finances.

36
We're professors, Hannah. Professors.

37
We can't keep bankrolling
your groovy lifestyle.

38
My "groovy" lifestyle?

39
The bills add up.
We're covering your rent,

40
your insurance, your cell phone.

41
You said it was cheaper for you
if I was on the family plan.

42
Yeah.

43
May I get you more of anything?

44
No, she's fine.

45
-Delicious.
-Yeah.

46
This is nuts.

47
Ted, can you help me here?

48
I could be a drug addict.
Do you realize how lucky you are?

49
I mean, it doesn't have to be heroin,

50
it could be something
more insidious, like pills.

51
Which are legal,
and which a lot of kids do, all the time.

52
And then slowly,
they become totally useless.

53
They seem really high-functioning,
and then it just ruins them.

54
Okay, my friend Sophie,
her parents don't support her.

55
Last summer, she had two abortions

56
right in a row, and no one came with her.

57
What does that have to do with anything?

58
I'm just saying that
I am so close to the life that I want,

59
the life that you want for me,
that for you to just end that right now?

60
No more money.

61
-Starting when?
-Starting now.

62
We can talk about it tomorrow.

63
I don't want to see you tomorrow.

64
-What?
-But we fly our Tuesday.

65
I have work,
and then I have a dinner thing,

66
and then I am busy

67
trying to become who I am.

68
Alarm.

69
What?

70
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

71
Miss? You are here.

72
Already?

73
Good morning, Charlie.

74
Why didn't you wake me up?

75
I didn't mean to sleep with Hannah.

76
Because you two looked so angelic.

77
Victoria's secret angel, fat baby angel.

78
-Don't say that.
-No way, you look awesome these days.

79
Please avert your eyes.

80
Is that a present?

81
Is that for me?

82
-Give it here.
-Thank you.

83
You guys fell asleep
to Mary Tyler Moore again, huh?

84
Yes, guilty.

85
It's a very odd show
to hear through a wall.

86
Coming at ya.

87
Here it comes.

88
Pow!

89
I just blew up a kiss on you.

90
-Are you going to leave your towel on?
-Yes.

91
But I never see you naked,
and you always see me naked.

92
When it should actually
be the other way around.

93
-You are beautiful, shut up.
-I don't need that.

94
-I need to see your boobs.
-Well, you don't get to, sorry.

95
I only show my boobs
to people I'm having sex with.

96
You literally slept
in my bed to avoid him.

97
I know.

98
Hannah, I’ve turned a corner.

99
His touch now feels like

100
a weird uncle just putting
his hand on my knee at Thanksgiving.

101
What are you going to do?

102
-I think I have to end it.
-You can't do that.

103
I have to. Why not?

104
'Cause he'll stand
outside our window with a boom box

105
-or he'll kill himself.
-Stop.

106
Hey, babe.

107, Sorry. I thought it was
just my girlfriend in here.

108
Dude, it's never just
your girlfriend in here.

109
I'm just saying goodbye.

110
I'll see you ladies tonight,
and I'll pick up wine.

111
Okay, big kisses.

112
Bye.

113
What does it even feel like
to be loved that much?

114
I don't know. I can't feel it anymore.

115
Oh, no.

116
I know, I just...

117
And it makes me feel like such a bitch
'cause I can feel him being so nice to me.

118
And yet it makes me so angry.

119
I think you need to
admit something to yourself,

120
which is that you're sick
of eating him out.

121
'Cause he has a vagina.

122
-Hi.<i> Ca VA?</i>
-<i>Bonjour</i>, rookie.

123
Oh, my god. You're so hip, I could puke.

124
I can never pull off that hat.
How do you pull off that hat?

125
I love your jumper.

126
Your skin is, like, hauntingly beautiful.

127
-Can I put my bags down?
-What?

128
Oh, my god, of course.

129
You're like my favorite cousin.

130
I'm the only one of my girlfriends
that has a British cousin.

131
Well, how long do you think
you're going to stay for?

132
I mean, not that I'm asking you to leave.

133
You can totally stay forever
if you want to.

134
-Can I have something to eat?
-Yeah.

135
You've been interning there for a year.

136
You need to tell them
it's time to get paid.

137
Costs a lot of money to look this cheap.

138
This is not a joke. If you can't
afford to pay your half of the rent,

139
Charlie is going to move in here.

140
-You're dumping Charlie.
-I didn't say that.

141
So I texted Adam about tonight,
and I have not heard anything back.

142
Hannah, look at me.

143
He never, ever texts you back.

144
Maybe I should call him.

145
I mean, didn't you say texting's like
the lowest form of communication

146
-on the pillar of chat?
-The totem of chat,

147
and no, the lowest,
that would be Facebook,

148
followed by chat, then texting,

149
-then email, then phone.
-Got you.

150
Face-to-face is, of course, ideal.
But it's not of this time.

151
Okay, but then how am I
supposed to get him face-to-face

152
if he refuses to text me?

153
Think Jessa will really appreciate
the welcome-home dinner.

154
It's a very fiendish thing of us to do.

155
What?

156
I just know she's going to show up late,

157
wearing some fabulous blankety dress

158
from a Grecian marketplace and be like,

159
"Oh, I can't remember where I got this."

160
I'm really glad that she's coming home.

161
But every time she comes into town,

162
you go on some week-long bender,

163
and then she leaves
to go off to her next country

164
and I'm left to pick up the pieces.

165
Okay, it is so rare that I say this,

166
but I just think she's fun.

167
Yeah, it was really fun
when she fucked Carolyn’s boyfriend.

168
She didn't fuck your boyfriend.

169
That's 'cause he was
in Prague that semester.

170
Thanks so much.

171
It's a great deal for Lolita.

172
I mean 2,100 a month? Amaze.

173
It's a little more expensive
than the dorms,

174
but Aunt Ilene thinks
it's like the perfect bachelorette pad.

175
I mean...

176
Do you like the poster?

177
Oh, you know, I've never seen that movie.

178
-Only the show?
-Is it a show?

179
Oh, my god. You're not serious.

180
I mean, that's like not being on Facebook.

181
-I'm not on Facebook.
-You're so fucking classy.

182
You know, you're funny
because you're definitely like a Carrie

183
but with, like, some Samantha aspects
and Charlotte hair.

184
-That's like a perfect combination.
-Oh, thank you.

185
I think I'm definitely a Carrie at heart,

186
but, like, sometimes...

187
sometimes Samantha kinds of comes out.

188
And then, I mean, when I’m a school,

189
I definitely try
and put on my Miranda hat.

190
Where were you before France?

191
Before France, I was in Amsterdam...

192
No, I was in Bali,

193
and I was shucking pearls there.

194
And then I met a surfer--

195
Oh, my god. Did he really like you?

196
-He really liked you, right?
-Yeah, he really liked me.

197
-Hannah?
-Hello, Alistair.

198
Hello.

199
You seem eager.

200
As you know,
I've been working here for over a year.

201
Has it been that long?

202
Well, you are an invaluable part
of our operation.

203
Which I recently learned
means very valuable

204
as opposed to not at all valuable.

205
And I wanted to let you know
that my circumstances have changed

206
and I can no longer afford
to work for free.

207
Oh, Hannah.

208
I am so sorry to lose you.

209
I was just going to
start you manning our Twitter,

210
you have just the Quincy voice for that.

211
Oh, no, I'm not quitting.

212
I just... I know that Joy-Lynn
got hired after interning,

213
-so I thought that maybe--
- Hannah.

214
Joy-Lynn knows Photoshop.

215
Now, in this economy,

216
do you know how many
internship requests I get every day?

217
-I would assume a lot.
-Fifty, it's about fifty.

218
I practically route them
into my spam folders.

219
So, if you think you have
just nothing left to learn from us...

220
No, it is not that, really.

221
I just, you know, got to eat.

222
Well, when you get hungry enough,

223
you're going to figure it out.

224
Do you mean like
physically hungry or hungry for the job?

225
I am really going to miss your energy.

226
I think this is going to be
perfect for you.

227
You mentioned that
when I was finished with my book,

228
I could send it to you.

229
Well, we wouldn't have you here

230
to read it for us. Would we?

231
Where are you going?

232
Will you get me a Luna Bar?

233
And a Smart water and Vitamin water?

234
Yo, hey.

235
Yeah, no, I'm actually
just leaving a friend's house

236
that's, like, right by your house, so...

237
Yeah?

238
-Hey, doll.
-Hey.

239
"Doll," that is what my dad calls me.

240
Yeah, I know. He told me.
We're in the same circle jerk.

241
-I just had the worst every day.
-You were nearby?

242
Why?

243
I got fired from my job, so...

244
Weren't you an intern?

245
Well, I was working there for a while

246
-so I was technically an intern.
-So basically,

247
they just asked you
to not hang out there anymore?

248
When I was walking over here--

249
Funny. I was on my way
over here, and I was panicking,

250
but then it occurred to me,
like, I'm an English major,

251
-there has to be some kind of--
- Major doesn't matter.

252
I was comp lit and it hasn't done shit.

253
Yeah, but you're an actor, so aren't you
always comparing different literature?

254
I don't know.

255
Plus, I'm into this woodworking stuff.
It's just more honest.

256
Yeah, it all looks awesome.
But what about your play?

257
Yeah, we're not doing it.
That guy's a dick.

258
Can I sit down?

259
Yeah.

260
So, if I tell you something,
will you promise that you won't judge me?

261
Yes.

262
'Til yesterday, I got all
of my money from my parents.

263
Okay.

264
Does that make you feel sick?
Make you not want to talk to me?

265
No, I mean I wouldn't take shit
from my parents. They're buffoons.

266
But my grandma gives me
800 dollars a month.

267
So is, like, that
how you support yourself or...

268
Yeah. I mean, I supplement.

269
But it gives me the freedom
that I don't have to be anyone's slave.

270
You should never be
anyone's fucking slave.

271
Except mine.

272
You're feeling pretty frisky.

273
I really despise that word.
I hate it so much.

274
I like you so much.
I don't know where you disappear to.

275
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

276
It's so funny that it's still light out,

277
but it's getting dark
a lot earlier these days.

278
-Is this some of your poetry?
-Don't be a jerk.

279
Who, me?

280
Do you know that part on your resume

281
where they ask you to list
all of your special skills?

282
I haven't applied for a job
in a long fucking time.

283
Okay, well, it's the thing
where they ask you to list, like,

284
yoga, Spanish, waterskiing, Photoshop.

285
I feel like I--

286
don't have any special skills.

287
-I have something you can do.
-What?

288
But first, I have to see
if you fulfill all the requirements.

289
What are the requirements?

290
Lie on your stomach.

291
-Now?
-Yes, now. Wait.

292
You modern career woman,
I know what you like.

293
You think you can just come in here

294
and talk all that noise?

295
Now?

296
Grab your legs.

297
-Just... what did you say?
-Grab your legs.

298
Okay.

299
Okay, this is good.

300
-I'm going to go get some lube.
-Why do we need to get lube?

301
When I get back, I want you
in the exact same position,

302
but take all the rest of the shit off.

303
Will you get a condom?

304
I'll consider it.

305
Jesus fucking Christ.

306
This is really hard.

307
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

308
-You putting on a condom?
-No!

309
-Wait, you are, right?
-Yes.

310
Okay, 'cause when you said
the thing about lube,

311
I was worried you were going to try to

312
do that. Please don't do that.

313
That feels awful. Thank you.

314
-It's all right.
-Okay. Thank you.

315
That's the right spot.

316
Yeah, sorry.

317
So I can just stay like this
for a little while?

318
Yeah.

319
-Do you need me to move more?
-What?

320
I just didn't know if you wanted me
to be more like... like that.

321
Oh, no. This is fine. You're doing great.

322
This is all you need to do.

323
I'm sorry about the wrong hole thing.

324
I just... I don't want to do it now,

325
and, like, if we did,
I'd just want to talk about it

326
and just figure out what...
It's just not comfortable for me--

327
-Let's play the quiet game.
-So you're not mad at me?

328
No, I'm great.

329
A great time.

330
<i>You know what would be crazy?</i>

331
<i>-What would be crazy?</i>
<i>-Like if we...</i>

332
just got crazy, right here right now.

333
We could just do that.

334
I mean, nobody's stopping us.
Nobody's home.

335
What would turn you on the most right now?

336
What would turn me on the most?

337
What would turn you on the most?

338
To turn you on,
that's what would turn me on.

339
-Let me do that.
-Okay.

340
What if you were a stranger?

341
-Oh, yeah, a stranger.
-Right? What if...

342
What if you were just like
a totally different person?

343
You didn't act like you?

344
I think Jessa's here.

345
-Oh, no. I think that might be Ray.
-You invited Ray?

346
It was going to be
like a four-person party.

347
That's called dinner.

348
Gosh, I'm sorry.

349
What's with all the tattoos?

350
What do you mean?

351
Why'd you do all of them?

352
They're illustrations
from children's books mostly.

353
Even the one on your ass?

354
No. That one, my friend Jessa did
sophomore year with a safety pin.

355
It's a snake wrapped around the moon.

356
When did you do that?

357
I did them mostly in high school.

358
Why?

359
Truthfully? I gained
a bunch of weight very quickly,

360
and I just felt
very out of control of my own body,

361
and it was just like
I had the idea of like,

362
"I'm taking control of my own shape."

363
-You know, I was fat in high school.
-Really?

364
Yeah, but I didn't go
drawing all over myself.

365
You're not that fat anymore.
You can just have them lasered off.

366
What time is it?

367
Five o’clock.

368
What time is it?

369
Nine forty-five.

370
I am so late for this dinner thing.

371
Fuck.

372
Seriously, this was really, really nice.

373
It was perfect to see you.

374
I'm glad. Thanks for coming.

375
It made me feel a lot better, so...

376
I'll see you soon?

377
Yeah, just text me.

378
It's not like they're commandments,
but generally speaking,

379
as a general rule, I try not to
date women that are under 25

380
or that have been, at one point
in their life, penetrated by a drummer.

381
-One time!
-Guilty of both.

382
But I was walking through
the mall this morning,

383
I just see these two huge green orbs
bobbing through the mall.

384
I mean, look at these eyes!

385
-Have you seen these eyes?
-They're my eyes!

386
-He's so nice to me.
-Ridiculous.

387
Look at those lashes, too.
Have you seen these lashes?

388
-Guilty as charged.
-So cute.

389
-You okay?
-Yeah.

390
I just can't believe
Hannah didn't show up.

391
We're here. Living it up. Partying down.

392
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm just not really into eating this week.

393
Hannah was the one
saying this was our big reunion

394
and now she's nowhere to be found.

395
Are you worried?
I mean, should we call someone?

396
No, especially because
I know exactly where she is.

397
She's off having gross sex
with that animal.

398
In what way gross?

399
Charlie would like to
at least hear about some sex.

400
Excuse me?

401
Ray's just being,
you know, like motivational.

402
I mean, come on, at least you didn't
have to entertain Jessa on her own.

403
Yeah, 'cause I didn't
get to entertain anybody

404
because no one came.

405
-Hannah! Marnie!
-Who's that? She sounds British.

406
Oh, I ordered a few hookers,
if you guys don't mind.

407
Bulgarian girls. Top-shelf.

408
-Nice girls.
-He kills me. I swear to god.

409
Marnie!

410
Top lock!

411
Paris is really where you should be.

412
If you're a Francophile like...

413
-Me and you, obviously.
-Yeah.

414
-Then you've got to go to France.
-You have to go.

415
I was a live-in educator
for these three children,

416
and they all sang.

417
And their father
was a brilliant pacifist thinker.

418
Isn't that the plot to<i> The Sound of Music</i>?

419
-It is.
-We really want to travel more.

420–We could just go.
-Up and go.

421
I am so sorry I'm so late.

422
-Hannah banana.
-Would you please come here

423
-and talk to us?
-Hello.

424
You're here. You're here. Hi.

425
What's going on? You look beautiful.

426
-What'd you say?
-What's going on?

427
-She smells like sex.
-No, but you showered this morning.

428
So I calculated,
and I can last in New York

429
for three and a half more days.

430
Maybe seven if I don't eat lunch.

431
I'm going to find you a job
worthy of your talents.

432
Well, I appreciate that,

433
but I don't know how you're going to
find a job fast enough.

434
I'm going to have
to work at, like, McDonald's.

435
You're not going to work at McDonald's.

436
What's wrong with McDonald's?
You should work at McDonald's.

437
It's great. It's fucking incredible.

438
You know how many people
McDonald's feeds every day?

439
You know how many people
it employs around the world?

440
Plus, they make
an incredible product, okay?

441
It tastes tremendous.

442
It's affordable. It's fucking consistent.

443
I can walk into a McDonald's in Nigeria,

444
order Chicken McNuggets.

445
When I bite into it,
you know what it's going to taste like?

446
It's going to taste like home.

447
It doesn't mean I have to work there.
I went to college.

448
Yeah, I went to college, too.
You know where it left me?

449
I have 50,000 dollars in student loans.

450
That's how deep in debt I am.

451
I'm sorry, but watching this,
this is like watching<i> Clueless</i>.

452
The movie or the TV show?

453
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing over there?

454
I'm making a little brew.

455
He's making a tea of opium pods.

456
Oh, cool. So you brought opium
into our apartment.

457
Well, yeah, this stuff's pretty mild.

458
This is much milder
than the stuff you'd smoke.

459
It's legal. I got it down
at the flower district.

460
You can just go there and buy the pods.

461
-Is it cool if I have a little?
-Knock yourself out.

462
-I hate opium.
-Oh, yeah, what's your thing? Coke?

463
No, I never do coke.

464
Every time I do coke, I shit my pants.

465
Oh, Jesus Christ.

466
-That's horrible.
-It happens.

467
-What does it taste like?
-It kind of tastes like twigs.

468
-Yeah, I'll have some.
-Maybe you shouldn't.

469
You're super sensitive to drugs.

470
I think I'm going to be fine, okay?
Hand it over.

471
It's hot.

472
Oh, Jesus.

473
This does not taste like Twix.

474
Not Twix, twigs.

475
Twigs, like small sticks.

476
If you're going to vanish,
you have to call, okay?

477
Yeah, okay. I want to go back in there.

478
No, you can't.
I need to talk to you first.

479
All you need to do
is talk to your parents, okay?

480
You need to ask them to support you

481
for a little itty-bitty longer,
just while you look for another job.

482
And tell them that
you take your future seriously.

483
Because you do. You're Hannah.

484
-Does Charlie have a girlfriend?
-Yes.

485
Marnie was just saying that she feels
like I need to go and talk to my parents

486
and ask them to support me
until I get a job.

487
Why don't you just tell them
that you're an artist?

488
You just need to tell them
once and for all

489
-that you are an artist.
-Just tell them

490
you're going to get a job,
that's much more convincing.

491
Tell them you'll get tuberculosis
in a garret if you have to.

492
Tell them it's what Flaubert did.

493
Flaubert is not a good role model,
and have you met her parents?

494
She can't just do the artist thing.

495
Tell them that Picasso did it.

496
Rappers who were poor
and sold their tapes in the street did it.

497
It's what Elvis did.
It's what Mick Jagger did.

498
It's what my stepbrother did.

499
They all stuck to their guns.

500
I need to go.

501
You just drank an entire cup of opium.

502
You are gorgeous and a vision.

503
You are a brilliant genius.

504
Both of you are sex goddesses.

505
When I look at both of you,
a Coldplay song plays in my heart.

506
Bye.

507
God, she seems like
she's in such a good place.

508
<i>Mom? Papa?</i>

509
-I think that's Hannah.
-Did she just call me papa?

510
-Hi!
-Oh, hey.

511
What the heck are you doing here?

512
I thought you didn't
want to see us anymore.

513
Actually, I couldn't bear the idea
of not seeing you before you left town.

514
But more important...
Here, you can sit down.

515
It's late. I'm sorry.

516
is that I brought you my book.

517
I need you to read it.

518
Jesus, it's hot.

519
-Great. Yeah.
-That's fine.

520
Are you boiling?

521
Great, we'll read it on the plane.

522
No, now. I need you to read it now.

523
Because...

524
I don't want to freak you out,

525
but I think that I may be
the voice of my generation.

526
Or at lease a voice

527
of a generation.

528
Well, just read.
Don't be scared, just enjoy it

529
'cause there's going to be plenty
for us to talk about after.

530
Just go for it.

531
I need to talk to you.

532
All right.

533
I do not like
what just went down out there. At all.

534
What, with Hannah?

535
Yeah, I guess I just don't
understand the problem.

536
-She seemed ready.
-She had just gotten high.

537
I'd like for you
to see a real high person.

538
Marnie, you can't mother her like that.

539
I'm not mothering her. I'm literally
preventing a disaster from happening.

540
Have you even read her novel?

541
It's a memoir, and of course
I've read it, I'm her best friend.

542
Best friend. This is my best friend.

543
You know, we don't own anybody.

544
Maybe you don't respect
what the best friendship means

545
because you've never stayed
in one place long enough to have one.

546
Marnie, I can't help your feelings.

547
Maybe you can help to be two hours late

548
to a dinner party that was thrown for you.

549
-My god! Yes.
-It was two hours?

550
-When was dinner?
-Seven!

551
Seven? I thought
that was just a suggestion.

552
A smuggest... Okay, I'm sorry
we don't eat at one in the morning,

553
but we don't live in Barcelona.

554
Maybe not one, but ten, ten’s reasonable.

555
See, this is what you do.
You act like I'm uptight,

556
and then I follow suit. I become uptight.

557
It is the most frustrating dynamic
on the planet.

558
-It drives me crazy. I can't stand it.
-I'm fucking pregnant.

559
All right? I'm pregnant.

560
-On purpose?
-What do you think?

561
I have to tell you something, you two.

562
You guys are so beautiful.

563
Okay, all right.

564
That's a high person.

565
-This is very funny stuff, Doreen.
-Yeah.

566
-Hannah, you're a very funny girl.
-Thank you, papa.

567
-Okay.
-Oh.

568
All I am asking for to finish this book

569
is 1,100 dollars a month

570
for the next two years.

571
-That's insane.
-That's a chunk of change.

572
You would say it's insane.
Who can live in New York

573
on 1,100 dollars a month?

574
But I am so committed to this book

575
that I am willing
to get pretty thrifty on this.

576
Why don't you get a job and start a blog?

577
You are so spoiled.

578
Yeah, well, whose fault is that, Mom?

579
-Your father's.
-You know this is making me so unhappy.

580
-I'm having such a horrible feeling.
-Oh, we're not Amu, Hannah.

581
And the least you can do
is sit up straight and...

582
Hannah?

583
Hannah, Jesus. Hannah?

584
I shouldn't have taken it,
but I was just having such a bad day.

585
Taken what? What did you take?

586
Is she sick, Tad?
Do I need to call a hospital?

587
I think she may be high.

588
-It's legal, like flowers.
-Oh, my god.

589
I'm not going to be angry, Hannah.
All right, I'm just really curious.

590
-What did you smoke?
-It's opium pods.

591
It's a tea of opium pods.

592–We should Google that.
-I don't need to Google that.

593
I know about that.
It's tantamount to smoke banana peels.

594
For Christ's sake,
let's just order her a coffee.

595
Coffee's for grown-ups.

596
You're going to drink
a strong cup of coffee!

597
I'm 24 years old!
Don't tell me what to do.

598
This is a real display.

599
No, this is the immediate result
of a cold approach.

600
You can't just pull the rug out

601
-from under her so suddenly.
-Why are you doing this?

602
We should stay a few more days.

603
Look, I admire your kind heart,
I really do.

604
But you're getting played
by a major fucking player!

605
I know! But it's hard
for me to watch her struggle!

606
My skirt feels so tight.

607
Maybe you can just cut it
open with scissors?

608
It's like watching her get a shot!

609
-Shots keep people from getting sick!
-Well...

610
-I want a lake house. I work hard.
-I know.

611
I want to sit by a fucking lake.

612
-You deserve a lake.
-I'm going to die

613
like Flaubert in a garret.

614
Don't look at me.

615
Mom?

616
Dad?

617
Hi, I'm in room 2507,
and I wanted to get some room service.

618
But is the account totally closed
if they've checked out?

619
You can't add anything?

620
Okay, no. Yeah, got it.

621
I'm leaving right now. Thank you.

622
Why don't you smile?

623
Does your heart hurt?

624
Oh, girl, when I look at you,
I just want to say,

625
"Hello, New York!"
