1
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,853
Will you two slow down?

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,980
You're eating like
they're going to take it away from you.

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,148
I'm a growing girl.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,113
It's such a pleasure seeing you
and seeing how well work is going.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,240
Work's going really well, yeah.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,451
My boss said that he wants to see my book
when it's done, which is really exciting.

7
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,495
Where are you at with that?

8
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,789
Oh, well, I've done four of the essays,

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,249
and I'm just kind of polishing them up.

10
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,917
And my hope is that it's going to be nine.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,336
But you know, it's a memoir.
So, I have to live them first.

12
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,549
Tad, I don't want to just leave it
'til the end of dinner.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,633
I hear that.

14
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,597
Hannah, your mother
and I have been talking,

15
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,474
and we feel that it may be time...

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,893
How can I phrase this?

17
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,854
Well, we see how well
you're doing at work,

18
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,648
and you really seem to be
figuring out what it is that you want.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,527
But it may be time for one final push.

20
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,863
What is a "final push"?

21
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,073
We're not going to be
supporting you any longer.

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,825
You see, I wasn't going
to phrase it like that, Loreen,

23
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,952
- the way you phrased it.
- But I have no job.

24
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,539
No, you have an internship
that you say is going to turn into a job.

25
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,707
I don't know when.

26
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,126
You graduated from college two years ago.

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,879
We've been supporting you
for two years, and that's enough.

28
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,258
Do you know how crazy
the economy is right now?

29
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,968
I mean, all my friends
get help from their parents.

30
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,469
We are sympathetic to that.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,222
But I'm your only child.

32
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,057
It's not like I'm draining
all your resources.

33
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,684
I mean, this feels very arbitrary.

34
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,103
You don't know anything
about our finances.

35
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,106
We're professors, Hannah. Professors.

36
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,693
We can't keep bankrolling
your groovy lifestyle.

37
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,945
My "groovy" lifestyle?

38
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,113
The bills add up.

39
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,241
We're covering your rent,
your insurance, your cell phone.

40
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,869
You said it was cheaper for you
if I was on the family plan.

41
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,912
Yeah.

42
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,122
May I get you more of anything?

43
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,041
No, she's fine.

44
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,877
- Delicious.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,547
This is nuts.

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,758
Tad, can you help me here?

47
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,677
I could be a drug addict.
Do you realize how lucky you are?

48
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,012
I mean, it doesn't have to be heroin.

49
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,014
It could be something
more insidious like pills,

50
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,892
which are legal,
and which a lot of kids do all the time.

51
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,312
And then slowly,
they become totally useless.

52
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,023
They seem really high-functioning,
and then it just ruins them.

53
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,317
Okay, my friend Sophie,
her parents don't support her.

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,195
Last summer,
she had two abortions right in a row,

55
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,030
and no one came with her.

56
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,074
What does that have to do with anything?

57
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm just saying that
I am so close to the life that I want,

58
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,497
the life that you want for me,
that for you to just end that right now?

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,124
No more money.

60
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,462
- Starting when?
- Starting now.

61
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,840
We can talk about it tomorrow.

62
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,132
I don't want to see you tomorrow.

63
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,051
- What?
- But we fly out Tuesday.

64
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,054
I have work,
and then, I have a dinner thing,

65
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,599
and then I am busy
trying to become who I am.

66
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
Alarm.

67
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:37,968
What?

68
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,060
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

69
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,362
Miss? You are here.

70
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,324
Already?

71
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,541
Good morning, Charlie.

72
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,835
Why didn't you wake me up?

73
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,295
I didn't mean to sleep with Hannah.

74
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,380
Because you two looked so angelic.

75
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,342
Victoria's secret angel. Fat baby angel.

76
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,261
- Don't say that.
- No way. You look awesome these days.

77
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,347
Please avert your eyes.

78
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:26,767
Is that a present?

79
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,393
Is that for me?

80
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,064
- Give it here.
- Thank you.

81
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,191
You guys fell asleep
to Mary Tyler Moore again, huh?

82
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,652
Yes, guilty.

83
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,695
It's a very odd show
to hear through a wall.

84
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:39,988
Coming at you.

85
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:41,782
Here it comes.

86
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,245
I just blew up a kiss on you.

87
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,457
- Are you going to leave your towel on?
- Yes.

88
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,835
But I never see you naked,
and you always see me naked

89
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,419
when it should actually
be the other way around.

90
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,547
- You are beautiful. Shut up.
- I don't need that.

91
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,049
- I need to see your boobs.
- Well, you don't get to. Sorry.

92
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,093
I only show my boobs
to people I'm having sex with.

93
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,428
You literally slept
in my bed to avoid him.

94
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,471
I know.

95
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,765
Hannah, I’ve turned a corner.

96
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,268
His touch now feels like

97
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,646
a weird uncle just putting
his hand on my knee at Thanksgiving.

98
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,897
What are you going to do?

99
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,775
- I think I have to end it.
- You can't do that.

100
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,860
I have to. Why not?

101
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,445
'Cause he'll stand
outside our window with a boom box,

102
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,739
- or he'll kill himself.
- Stop.

103
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,657
Hey, babe.

104
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,201
Sorry. I thought it was
just my girlfriend in here.

105
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:27,578
Dude, it's never just
your girlfriend in here.

106
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,579
I'm just saying goodbye.

107
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,664
I'll see you ladies tonight,
and I'll pick up wine.

108
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
Okay, big kisses.

109
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,251
Bye.

110
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,963
What does it even feel like
to be loved that much?

111
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,090
I don't know. I can't feel it anymore.

112
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,258
Oh, no.

113
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,885
I know, I just...

114
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,763
And it makes me feel like such a bitch
'cause I can feel him being so nice to me,

115
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,516
and yet it makes me so angry.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,185
I think you need
to admit something to yourself,

117
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,061
which is that you're sick
of eating him out.

118
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,689
'Cause he has a vagina.

119
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,204
- Hi.<i> Ca va?</i>
-<i> Bonjour</i>, roomie.

120
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,788
Oh, my god. You're so hip, I could puke.

121
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,499
I can never pull off that hat.
How do you pull off that hat?

122
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,627
I love your jumper.

123
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,922
Your skin is, like, hauntingly beautiful.

124
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,299
- Can I put my bags down?
- What?

125
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,134
Oh, my god, of course.

126
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,261
You're like my favorite cousin.

127
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,514
I'm the only one of my girlfriends
that has a British cousin.

128
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,390
Well, how long do you think
you're going to stay for?

129
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,308
I mean, not that I'm asking you to leave.

130
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,809
You can totally stay forever
if you want to.

131
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,521
- Can I have something to eat?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,689
You've been interning there for a year.

133
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,108
You need to tell them
it's time to get paid.

134
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,985
Costs a lot of money to look this cheap.

135
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,364
This is not a joke. If you can't
afford to pay your half of the rent,

136
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,366
Charlie is going to move in here.

137
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,743
- You're dumping Charlie.
- I didn't say that.

138
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,747
So I texted Adam about tonight,
and I have not heard anything back.

139
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,998
Hannah, look at me.

140
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,417
He never, ever texts you back.

141
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,627
Maybe I should call him.

142
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,255
I mean, didn't you say texting's, like,
the lowest form of communication

143
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,215
- on the pillar of chat?
- The totem of chat.

144
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,050
And no, the lowest,
that would be Facebook,

145
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,511
followed by gChat, then texting,

146
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,096
- then email, then phone.
- Got you.

147
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,890
Face-to-face is, of course, ideal.
But it's not of this time.

148
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,892
Okay, but then how am I
supposed to get him face-to-face

149
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,727
if he refuses to text me?

150
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,356
Think Jessa will really appreciate
the welcome-home dinner.

151
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,233
It's a very friendish thing of us to do.

152
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,195
-What?
-I just know she's going to show up late,

153
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,199
wearing some fabulous blankety dress
from a Grecian marketplace and be like,

154
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,993
"Oh, I can't remember where I got this."

155
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm really glad that she's coming home.

156
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,830
But every time she comes into town,

157
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,415
you go on some week-long bender,

158
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,250
and then, she leaves
to go off to her next country

159
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,960
and I'm left to pick up the pieces.

160
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,837
Okay, it is so rare that I say this,

161
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,255
but I just think she's fun.

162
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,799
Yeah, it was really fun
when she fucked Carolyn’s boyfriend.

163
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,259
She didn't fuck your boyfriend.

164
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,969
That's 'cause he was
in Prague that semester.

165
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:49,887
Thanks so much.

166
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,139
It's a great deal for Nolita.

167
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,558
I mean, 2,100 a month? Amaze.

168
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,268
It's a little more expensive
than the dorms,

169
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,687
but Aunt Ilene thinks
it's like the perfect bachelorette pad.

170
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,605
I mean...

171
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,941
Do you like the poster?

172
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,361
Oh, you know, I've never seen that movie.

173
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,572
- Only the show?
- Is it a show?

174
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,115
Oh, my god. You're not serious.

175
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,118
I mean, that's like not being on Facebook.

176
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,955
- I'm not on Facebook.
- You're so fucking classy.

177
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,375
You know, you're funny
because you're definitely like a Carrie

178
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,254
but with, like, some Samantha aspects
and Charlotte hair.

179
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,174
- That's like a really good combination.
- Oh, thank you.

180
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,260
I think I'm definitely a Carrie at heart,

181
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,678
but, like, sometimes...

182
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,348
Sometimes, Samantha kind of comes out.

183
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,390
And then, I mean, when I’m at school,

184
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,184
I definitely try
and put on my Miranda hat.

185
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,727
Where were you before France?

186
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:43,065
Before France, I was in Amsterdam...

187
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,274
No, I was in Bali,

188
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,485
and I was shucking pearls there.

189
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,947
- And then, I met a surfer--
- Oh, my god. Did he really like you?

190
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,950
- He, like, really liked you, right?
- Yeah, he really liked me.

191
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,006
- Hannah?
- Hello, Alistair.

192
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,843
Hello.

193
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,012
You seem eager.

194
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,807
As you know,
I've been working here for over a year.

195
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,350
Has it been that long?

196
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,187
Well, you are an invaluable part
of our operation.

197
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,523
Which I recently learned means
very valuable

198
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,024
as opposed to not at all valuable.

199
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,902
And I wanted to let you know
that my circumstances have changed,

200
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,113
and I can no longer afford
to work for free.

201
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,031
Oh, Hannah.

202
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,534
I am so sorry to lose you.

203
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,245
I was just going
to start you manning our Twitter.

204
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,163
You have just the quippy voice for that.

205
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,915
Oh, no, I'm not quitting.

206
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,711
I just... I know that Joy-Lynn
got hired after interning,

207
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,379
- so I thought that maybe--
- Hannah.

208
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,631
Joy-Lynn knows Photoshop.

209
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,383
Now, in this economy,

210
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,761
do you know how many
internship requests I get every day?

211
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,181
- I would assume a lot.
- Fifty. It's about 50.

212
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,516
I practically route them
into my spam folder.

213
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,270
So, if you think you have
just nothing left to learn from us...

214
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,314
No, it is not that, really.

215
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,357
I just, you know, got to eat.

216
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,402
Well, when you get hungry enough,

217
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,362
you're going to figure it out.

218
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,158
Do you mean, like,
physically hungry or hungry for the job?

219
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,329
I am really going to miss your energy.

220
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,623
I think this is going to be
really good for you.

221
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,338
You mentioned that
when I was finished with my book,

222
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,380
I could send it to you.

223
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:36,970
Well, we wouldn't have you here
to read it for us, would we?

224
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,188
Where are you going?

225
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,232
Will you get me a Luna Bar?

226
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,817
And a Smart water and Vitamin water?

227
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,118
Yo, hey.

228
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,579
Yeah, no, I'm actually
just leaving a friend's house

229
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,082
that's, like, right by your house, so...

230
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:07,918
Yeah?

231
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,257
- Hey, doll.
- Hey.

232
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,968
"Doll," that is what my dad calls me.

233
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,846
Yeah, I know. He told me.
We're in the same circle jerk.

234
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,392
- I just had the worst ever day.
- You were nearby?

235
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:24,935
Why?

236
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,480
I got fired from my job, so...

237
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,566
Weren't you an intern?

238
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,193
Well, I was working there for a while,

239
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,361
- so I was technically an intern.
- So basically,

240
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
they just asked you
to not hang out there anymore?

241
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,448
When I was walking over here...

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,953
Funny. I was on my way over here,
and I was panicking,

243
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,621
but then it occurred to me,
like, I'm an English major.

244
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,248
-There has to be some kind of--
- Major doesn't matter.

245
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,250
I was Comp Lit, and it hasn't done shit.

246
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,336
Yeah, but you're an actor, so aren't you
always comparing different literature?

247
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,047
I don't know.

248
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,553
Plus, I'm into this woodworking stuff.
It's just more honest.

249
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,264
Yeah, it all looks awesome.
But what about your play?

250
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,474
Yeah, we're not doing it.
That guy's a dick.

251
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,643
Can I sit down?

252
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:07,978
Yeah.

253
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,281
So, if I tell you something,
will you promise that you won't judge me?

254
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,366
Yes.

255
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,953
'Til yesterday, I got all
of my money from my parents.

256
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,163
Okay.

257
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,374
Does that make you feel sick?
Make you not want to talk to me?

258
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,878
No, I mean I wouldn't take shit
from my parents. They're buffoons.

259
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,422
But my grandma gives me
800 dollars a month.

260
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,302
So is that, like,
how you support yourself or...

261
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,263
Yeah. I mean, I supplement.

262
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,391
But it gives me the freedom
that I don't have to be anyone's slave.

263
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,062
You should never be
anyone's fucking slave,

264
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:51,897
except mine.

265
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,779
You're feeling pretty frisky.

266
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,281
I really despise that word.
I hate it so much.

267
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,500
I like you so much.
I don't know where you disappear to.

268
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,670
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

269
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,927
It's so funny that it's still light out,

270
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,137
but it's getting dark
a lot earlier these days.

271
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,932
- Is this some of your poetry?
- Don't be a jerk.

272
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,267
Who, me?

273
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,354
Do you know that part on your résumé

274
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,648
where they ask you to list
all of your special skills?

275
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,525
I haven't applied for a job
in a long fucking time.

276
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,819
Okay, well, it's the thing
where they ask you to list, like,

277
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,573
yoga, Spanish, waterskiing, Photoshop.

278
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,575
I feel like I

279
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,119
don't have any special skills.

280
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,913
- I have something you can do.
- What?

281
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,333
But first, I have to see
if you fulfill all the requirements.

282
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,043
What are the requirements?

283
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,253
Lie on your stomach.

284
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,298
- Now?
- Yes, now. Wait.

285
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,347
You modern career woman,
I know what you like.

286
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,143
You think you can just come in here
and talk all that noise?

287
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,854
No?

288
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,981
Grab your legs.

289
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,154
- Just what did you say?
- Grab your legs.

290
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,405
Okay.

291
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,616
Okay, this is good.

292
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,952
- I'm going to go get some lube.
- Why do we need to get lube?

293
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,789
When I get back,
I want you in the exact same position,

294
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,125
but take all the rest of the shit off.

295
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,668
Will you get a condom?

296
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,129
I'll consider it.

297
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,441
Jesus fucking Christ.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,735
This is really hard.

299
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,960
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

300
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,838
- You putting on a condom?
- No.

301
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,464
- Wait, you are, right?
- Yes.

302
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,007
Okay, 'cause when you said
the thing about lube,

303
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,551
I was worried you were going to try and

304
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,761
do that. Please don't do that.

305
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,721
That feels awful. Thank you.

306
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,100
- It's all right.
- Okay. Thank you.

307
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,852
That's the right spot.

308
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,728
Yeah, sorry.

309
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,772
So, I can just stay like this
for a little while?

310
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,690
Yeah.

311
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,776
- Do you need me to move more, or like...
- What?

312
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,237
I just didn't know
if you wanted me to be more, like...

313
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,489
-like that.
-Oh, no. This is fine. You're doing great.

314
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,699
This is all you need to do.

315
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,534
I'm sorry about the wrong hole thing.

316
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,703
I just... I don't want to do it now.

317
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,496
And, like, if we did,
I'd just want to talk about it

318
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,622
and just, like, figure out what...

319
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,584
- It's just not comfortable for me--
- Let's play the quiet game.

320
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,794
- So, you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm great.

321
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,838
Great time.

322
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,174
<i>You know what would be crazy?</i>

323
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,259
<i>- What would be crazy?</i>
<i>- Like if we...</i>

324
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,971
just got crazy right here, right now.

325
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,097
We could just do that.

326
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,975
I mean, nobody's stopping us.
Nobody's home.

327
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,561
What would turn you on the most right now?

328
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,022
What would turn me on the most?

329
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,609
What would turn you on the most?

330
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,528
To turn you on,
that's what would turn me on.

331
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,780
- Let me do that.
- Okay.

332
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,703
What if you were a stranger?

333
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,497
- Oh, yeah, a stranger.
- Right? What if...

334
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,583
What if you were just like
a totally different person?

335
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,169
You didn't act like you?

336
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,884
I think Jessa's here.

337
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,470
- Oh, no. I think that might be Ray.
- You invited Ray?

338
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,180
It was going to be
like a four-person party.

339
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,473
That's called dinner.

340
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,352
Gosh, I'm sorry.

341
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,312
What's with all the tattoos?

342
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,563
What do you mean?

343
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,566
Why'd you do all of them?

344
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,778
They're illustrations
from children's books mostly.

345
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,537
Even the one on your ass?

346
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,332
No. That one, my friend Jessa did
sophomore year with a safety pin.

347
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a snake wrapped around the moon.

348
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,710
When did you do that?

349
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,547
I did them mostly in high school.

350
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,715
Why?

351
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,470
Truthfully? I gained
a bunch of weight very quickly,

352
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,472
and I just felt
very out of control of my own body,

353
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,932
and it was just like
right where I had the idea, like,

354
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,059
"I'm taking control of my own shape."

355
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,524
- You know, I was fat in high school.
- Really?

356
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,734
Yeah, but I didn't go
drawing all over myself.

357
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,364
You're not that fat anymore.
You can just have them lasered off.

358
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,623
What time is it?

359
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,420
Five o’clock.

360
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,046
What time is it?

361
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,507
Nine forty-five.

362
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,218
I am so late for this dinner thing.

363
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:14,887
Fuck.

364
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,347
Seriously, this was really, really nice.

365
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,932
It was really good to see you.

366
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm glad. Thanks for coming.

367
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,687
It made me feel a lot better, so...

368
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,315
I'll see you soon?

369
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,567
Yeah, just text me.

370
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,620
It's not like they're commandments,
but generally speaking,

371
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,372
as a general rule,
I try not to date women that are under 25

372
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,792
or that have been, at one point
in their life, penetrated by a drummer.

373
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,252
- One time!
- Guilty of both.

374
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,795
But I was walking
through the mall this morning,

375
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,716
I just see these two huge green orbs
bobbing through the mall.

376
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,717
I mean, look at these eyes!

377
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,718
- Have you seen these eyes?
- They're my eyes!

378
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,261
- He's so nice to me.
- Ridiculous.

379
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,056
Look at those lashes, too.
Have you seen these lashes?

380
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,475
- Guilty as charged.
- So cute.

381
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,895
- You okay?
- Yeah.

382
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,064
I just can't believe
Hannah didn't show up.

383
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,067
We're here. Living it up. Partying down.

384
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,111
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm just not really into eating this week.

385
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,531
Hannah was the one
saying this was our big reunion,

386
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,449
and now, she's nowhere to be found.

387
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,535
Are you worried?
I mean, should we call someone?

388
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,912
No, especially because
I know exactly where she is.

389
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,748
She's off having gross sex
with that animal.

390
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,708
In what way, gross?

391
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,628
Charlie would like
to at least hear about some sex.

392
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,546
Excuse me?

393
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,674
Ray's just being,
you know, like motivational.

394
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,051
I mean, come on, at least you didn't
have to entertain Jessa on her own.

395
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,928
Yeah, 'cause I didn't
get to entertain anybody

396
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,096
because no one came.

397
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,974
- Hannah! Marnie!
- Who's that? She sounds British.

398
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,476
Oh, I ordered a few hookers,
if you guys don't mind.

399
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,395
Bulgarian girls. Top-shelf.

400
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,356
- Nice girls.
- He kills me, I swear to god.

401
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,524
Marnie!

402
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,778
Top lock.

403
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,873
Paris is really where you should be.

404
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,666
If you're a francophile like

405
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,169
- me and you, obviously.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,255
- Then, you've got to go to France.
- You have to go.

407
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,008
I was a live-in educator
for these three children,

408
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,342
and they all sang.

409
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,345
And their father
was a brilliant pacifist thinker.

410
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,306
Isn't that the plot to<i> The Sound of Music</i>?

411
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,767
- It is.
- We really want to travel more.

412
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,686
- We could just go.
- Up and go.

413
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,688
I am so sorry I'm so late.

414
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,523
- Hannah banana.
- Would you please come here

415
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,774
- and talk to us?
- Hello.

416
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,485
You're here. Hi.

417
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,530
What's going on? You look beautiful.

418
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,992
- What'd you say?
- What's going on?

419
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,205
- She smells like sex.
- No, but you showered this morning.

420
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,749
So I calculated,
and I can last in New York

421
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,250
for three and a half more days.

422
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,002
Maybe seven if I don't eat lunch.

423
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,713
I'm going to find you a job
worthy of your talents.

424
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,465
Well, I appreciate that,

425
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,300
but I don't know how you're going
to find a job fast enough.

426
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,010
I'm going to have
to work at, like, McDonald's.

427
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,637
You're not going to work at McDonald's.

428
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,430
What's wrong with McDonald's?
You should work at McDonald's.

429
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,517
It's great. It's fucking incredible.

430
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,435
You know how many people
McDonald's feeds every day?

431
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,937
You know how many people
it employs around the world?

432
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,105
Plus, they make
an incredible product, okay?

433
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,774
It tastes tremendous.

434
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,651
It's affordable. It's fucking consistent.

435
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,819
I can walk into a McDonald's in Nigeria,

436
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,946
order chicken McNuggets,

437
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,114
when I bite into it,
you know what it's going to taste like?

438
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,282
It's going to taste like home.

439
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,493
It doesn't mean I have to work there.
I went to college.

440
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,286
Yeah, I went to college too.
You know where it left me?

441
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,872
I have 50,000 dollars in student loans.

442
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:29,998
That's how deep in debt I am.

443
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:33,085
I'm sorry, but watching this,
it is like watching<i> Clueless</i>.

444
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,920
The movie or the TV show?

445
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,506
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing over there?

446
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,383
I'm making a little brew.

447
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,134
He's making a tea of opium pods.

448
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,595
Oh, cool. So you brought opium
into our apartment.

449
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,347
Well, yeah, this stuff's pretty mild.

450
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,724
This is much milder
than the stuff you'd smoke.

451
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,643
It's legal. I got it down
at the flower district.

452
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,186
You can just go there and buy the pods.

453
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,315
- Is it cool if I have a little?
- Knock yourself out.

454
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,318
- I hate opium.
- Oh, yeah, what's your thing? Coke?

455
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,987
No, I never do coke.

456
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,072
Every time I do coke, I shit my pants.

457
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,116
Oh, Jesus Christ.

458
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,742
- That's horrible.
- It happens.

459
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,120
- What does it taste like?
- It kind of tastes like twigs.

460
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,956
- Yeah, I'll have some.
- Maybe you shouldn't.

461
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,791
You're super sensitive to drugs.

462
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,960
I think I'm going to be fine, okay?
Hand it over.

463
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:16,378
It's hot.

464
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,633
Oh, Jesus.

465
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,094
This does not taste like Twix.

466
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,846
Not Twix. Twigs.

467
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,347
Twigs, like small sticks.

468
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,814
If you're going to vanish,
you have to call, okay?

469
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,443
Yeah, okay. I want to go back in there.

470
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,486
No, you can't.
I need to talk to you first.

471
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,615
All you need to do is
talk to your parents, okay?

472
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:49,161
You need to ask them to support you
for a little itty-bit longer

473
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,538
just while you look for another job.

474
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,957
And tell them
that you take your future seriously.

475
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,251
Because you do. You're Hannah.

476
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,463
- Does Charlie have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

477
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,591
Marnie was just saying that she feels
like I need to go and talk to my parents

478
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,010
and ask them to support me
until I get a job.

479
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,429
Why don't you just tell them
that you're an artist?

480
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,140
You just need to tell them
once and for all

481
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,184
- that you are an artist.
- Just tell them

482
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,020
you're going to get a job,
that's much more convincing.

483
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,190
Tell them you'll get tuberculosis
in a garret if you have to.

484
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,025
Tell them it's what Flaubert did.

485
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,195
Flaubert is not a good role model.
And have you met her parents?

486
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,280
She can't just do the artist thing.

487
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,865
Tell them that Picasso did it.

488
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:31,245
Rappers who were poor
and sold their tapes in the street did it.

489
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,206
It's what Elvis did.
It's what Mick Jagger did.

490
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,083
It's what my stepbrother did.

491
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,627
They all stuck to their guns.

492
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,670
I need to go.

493
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,090
You just drank an entire cup of opium.

494
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,259
You are gorgeous and a vision.

495
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,177
You are a brilliant genius.

496
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,805
Both of you are sex goddesses.

497
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,225
When I look at both of you,
a Coldplay song plays in my heart.

498
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,978
Bye.

499
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,024
God, she seems like
she's in such a good place.

500
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,903
<i>Mom? Papa?</i>

501
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,573
- I think that's Hannah.
- Did she just call me papa?

502
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,327
- Hi!
- Oh, hey.

503
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,328
What the heck are you doing here?

504
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,539
I thought you didn't
want to see us anymore.

505
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:21,420
Actually, I couldn't bear the idea
of not seeing you before you left town.

506
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,172
But more important...
Here, you can sit down.

507
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,339
It's late. I'm sorry.

508
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,635
...is that I brought you my book.

509
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,220
I need you to read it.

510
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,307
Jesus, it's hot.

511
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,516
- Great. Yeah.
- That's fine.

512
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,559
Are you boiling?

513
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,269
Great, we'll read it on the plane.

514
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:40,314
No, now.
I need you to read it now because...

515
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,066
I don't want to freak you out,

516
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,988
but I think that I may be
the voice of my generation.

517
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,326
Or at least a voice

518
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,411
of a generation.

519
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,247
Well, just read.
Don't be scared. Just enjoy it

520
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,499
'cause there's going to be plenty
for us to talk about after.

521
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,501
Just go for it.

522
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,422
I need to talk to you.

523
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,590
All right.

524
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,344
I do not like
what just went down out there at all.

525
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,261
What, with Hannah?

526
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,515
Yeah, I guess I just don't
understand the problem.

527
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,893
- She seemed ready.
- She had just gotten high.

528
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,063
I'd like for you
to see a real high person.

529
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,983
Marnie, you can't mother her like that.

530
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,362
I'm not mothering her. I'm literally
preventing a disaster from happening.

531
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,365
Have you even read her novel?

532
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,784
It's a memoir, and of course
I've read it, I'm her best friend.

533
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,786
"Best friend. This is my best friend."

534
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,329
You know, we don't own anybody.

535
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,498
Maybe you don't respect
what a best friendship means

536
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,334
because you've never stayed
in one place long enough to have one.

537
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,503
Marnie, I can't help your feelings.

538
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,130
Maybe you can help being two hours late

539
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,591
to a dinner party that was thrown for you.

540
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,385
- My god! Yes.
- It was two hours?

541
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,178
- When was dinner?
- Seven!

542
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,931
Seven? I thought
that was just a suggestion.

543
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,059
A suggest... Okay, I'm sorry
we don't eat at one in the morning,

544
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,602
but we don't live in Barcelona.

545
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,104
Maybe not 1, but 10.

546
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:03,272
Ten’s reasonable.

547
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,314
See, this is what you do.

548
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,609
You act like I'm uptight,
and then I follow suit. I become uptight.

549
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,903
It is the most frustrating dynamic
on the planet.

550
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,782
- It drives me crazy. I can't stand it.
- I'm fucking pregnant.

551
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,743
All right? I'm pregnant.

552
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,373
- On purpose?
- What do you think?

553
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,043
I have to tell you something, you two.

554
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,336
You guys are so beautiful.

555
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,176
Okay, all right.

556
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,679
That's a high person.

557
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,682
- This is very funny stuff, Loreen.
- Yeah.

558
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,727
- Hannah, you're a very funny girl.
- Thank you, Papa.

559
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,191
- Okay.
- Oh.

560
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,361
All I am asking for to finish this book

561
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,781
is 1,100 dollars a month

562
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,366
for the next two years.

563
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,702
- That's a chunk of change.
- That's insane.

564
00:26:58,785 --> 00:26:59,995
You would say it's insane.

565
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,789
Who can live in New York
on 1,100 dollars a month?

566
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,459
But I am so committed to this book

567
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,086
that I am willing
to get pretty thrifty on this.

568
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,423
Why don't you get a job and start a blog?

569
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,300
You are so spoiled.

570
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,260
Yeah, well, whose fault is that, Mom?

571
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:18,597
- Your father's.
- You know this is making me so unhappy.

572
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,017
- I'm having such a horrible feeling.
- Oh, we're not WaMu, Hannah.

573
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,061
And the least you can do is
sit up straight and...

574
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:24,978
Hannah?

575
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,732
Hannah, Jesus. Hannah?

576
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:29,775
- I shouldn't have taken it,
- Taken?

577
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:32,402
- but I was just having such a bad day.
- Taken what? What did you take?

578
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,279
Is she sick, Tad?
Do I need to call a hospital?

579
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,697
I think she may be high.

580
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,241
- It's legal, like flowers.
- Oh, my god.

581
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,493
I'm not going to be angry, Hannah.
All right, I'm just really curious.

582
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,662
- What did you smoke?
- It's opium pods.

583
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,288
It's a tea of opium pods.

584
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,957
- We should Google that.
- I don't need to Google that.

585
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,960
I know about that.
It's tantamount to smoking banana peels.

586
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,711
For Christ's sake,
let's just order her a coffee.

587
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:50,671
Coffee's for grown-ups.

588
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,506
You're going to drink
a strong cup of coffee!

589
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,217
I'm 24 years old!
Don't tell me what to do.

590
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,677
This is a real display.

591
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,971
No, this is the immediate result
of a cold approach.

592
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,055
You can't just pull the rug out

593
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,473
- from under her so suddenly.
- Why are you doing this?

594
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,558
We should stay a few more days.

595
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,227
Look, I admire your kind heart.
I really do.

596
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,896
But you're getting played
by a major fucking player!

597
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,315
I know! But it's hard
for me to watch her struggle!

598
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,025
My skirt feels so tight.

599
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,652
Maybe you can just cut it open
with scissors?

600
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,195
It's like watching her get a shot!

601
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,323
- Shots keep people from getting sick!
- Well...

602
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,534
- I want a lake house. I work hard.
- I know.

603
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,452
I want to sit by a fucking lake.

604
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,079
- You deserve a lake.
- I'm going to die

605
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,373
like Flaubert in a garret.

606
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,458
Don't look at me.

607
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,313
Mom?

608
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:52,941
Dad?

609
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,327
Hi, I'm in room 2507,
and I wanted to get some room service.

610
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,495
Oh.

611
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,291
But if the account is totally closed
if they've checked out,

612
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,834
you can't add anything?

613
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,670
Okay, no. Yeah, got it.

614
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,339
I'm leaving right now. Thank you.

615
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,660
Why don't you smile?

616
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,827
Does your heart hurt?

617
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,455
Oh, girl, when I look at you,
I just want to say,

618
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,792
"Hello, New York!"

619
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,400
