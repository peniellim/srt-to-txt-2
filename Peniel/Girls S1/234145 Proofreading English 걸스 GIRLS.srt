1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,134
- Yeah, do you like that?
- Yeah, I like that.

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,761
- What do you like?
- I like everything.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:11,929
I like what you're doing.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,975
I knew when I found you
that you wanted it this way.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,893
Found me where?

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,647
In the street, walking alone.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,150
But we didn't meet in the street.
We met at a party.

8
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,863
My god, on the street. Yeah, the street.

9
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,200
- Oh, yeah.
- You were a junkie, and you were only 11.

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,117
Okay.

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,454
And you had your fucking
cabbage patch lunchbox.

12
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:42,543
Yeah, and I was really scared
when I saw you.

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,171
- Okay.
- Fuck.

14
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,340
You're a dirty little whore
and I'm going to send you home

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,509
to your parents covered in cum.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,970
Oh, don't do that.
They're going to be so angry.

17
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,430
- Okay.
- Fuck.

18
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,933
- Okay.
- Where do you want me to come?

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,518
- Fuck.
- Where...

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,436
- What are the choices?
- Face? Tummy?

21
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,230
- Those little tits?
- Oh, my god. My tits--

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,523
It seems like you want to come on my tits,

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,234
so I think you should come on my tits
because I want you to come,

24
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,652
and it seems like you're going to do it.

25
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,613
- Touch yourself.
- Okay. Where?

26
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,365
- You know where. Touch yourself.
- Okay.

27
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,075
It's a little hard from this angle.

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,036
From now on,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,247
you have to ask my permission
whenever you want to come.

30
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,708
If you're touching yourself
and you think you're going to come,

31
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,334
you'd better fucking call me first.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,211
You want me to call you?

33
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:28,547
Okay.

34
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,550
I'm going to make the fucking continent
of Africa on your arm.

35
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,468
Fuck!

36
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,224
That was really good. That was so good.

37
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:40,976
I almost came.

38
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,898
You want a Gatorade?

39
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,358
What kind? What flavor?

40
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,111
Orange.

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,282
No, thanks. I'm good.

42
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:07,753
How does it feel?

43
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,171
How does it feel for you?

44
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,797
It feels good. Fine.

45
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,174
- It's good.
- Yeah, it does.

46
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,012
Oh, hey, look at me.

47
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,514
- Yeah.
- Look at me.

48
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,141
Let's look at each other when we come.

49
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:22,976
I'm going to turn around.

50
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,439
- But you hate doggie.
- No, I don't.

51
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,316
I just don't like doing it all the time.

52
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,735
No, you said it makes you
feel like a piggy bank.

53
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,862
No, I said it makes me
look like a piggy bank.

54
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,949
Okay. You ready?

55
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,075
I'm ready.

56
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:46,500
Fucking Jesus, this feels so good.

57
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,709
Okay, let's go.

58
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,420
Okay, I got to go slow.

59
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,924
Oh, my god.

60
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,718
Oh, my god.

61
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,686
Could you not smoke inside?

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,354
Oh.

63
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,147
Could you just...

64
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,149
Could you not smoke inside...

65
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,027
-It's, like, I'm totally cool, but--
-It's pot. Do you want some?

66
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,947
Oh, no, I'm hyper enough already.

67
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,701
What are you making?

68
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,079
It's my manifestation board.

69
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,874
I use it for inspiration.
Like, when I'm not feeling inspired,

70
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,458
- I just look at the board--
- Can I make one?

71
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,419
Oh, my god, totally.

72
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,920
You should totally make one.

73
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,590
We should make one together.

74
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,384
No, I want to make my own.

75
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,469
Yeah, much better idea.

76
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,762
Totes.

77
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,308
You know, Jessa, I'm...

78
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,271
What you're going through is, like,
really hard for any young woman,

79
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,608
and it totally makes sense that you would
want to escape through drug use,

80
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,610
but you have to know
that you're not just my cousin,

81
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,944
you're my friend.

82
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,324
And I could not be more proud
of you for getting this abortion.

83
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,037
Thanks, Shoshanna.

84
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,918
Okay, I think I got everything.

85
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,672
-Testicles, spectacles, wallet, watch...
-Okay, bye.

86
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,884
Did I leave anything in there with you?

87
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,802
No.

88
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,181
Where are you headed?

89
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,017
Don't you remember?
I'm a dirty little whore

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,560
going home to my parents covered in cum.

91
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,020
Your cum.

92
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:31,855
What?

93
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,358
That was a joke about the thing you said
last night when we were having sex,

94
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,777
about how you were going to send me home
to my parents covered in cum.

95
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,822
I'm...

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,283
I'm just going home
to get my cell phone charger,

97
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,494
and then I'm going
to a job interview, and then...

98
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,664
I'm actually accompanying
a friend to her abortion.

99
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,290
So, that's what I'm doing.

100
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,292
Shit.

101
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,546
That's kind of a heavy fucking situation.

102
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,382
Is it really? I mean I feel like
people say that it's a huge deal,

103
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,759
but how big a deal
are these things actually? I don't know.

104
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,344
Right. Yeah, it's just an abortion.

105
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,137
- That's silly.
- No. I'm not saying that.

106
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,138
I just mean, what was
she going to do, like,

107
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,683
have a baby and take it
to her babysitting job?

108
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,767
It's not realistic, so...

109
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:10,561
No shit, fucker.

110
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,564
I never thought
of it that way, but it's a good point.

111
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,399
I mean, I guess I don't really know,

112
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,693
because this is the first abortion
I've ever been to, so...

113
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,361
No, you don't say.

114
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,573
I really hope
you didn't find that flippant

115
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,908
because I did not mean
that abortions aren't a big deal.

116
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,285
I just meant
that I have very little sympathy

117
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,078
for people who do not use condoms,

118
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,455
because that is how you get pregnant,
and that is how you get diseases.

119
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,917
Well, I don't know what it is about me,
but girls never ask me to use condoms.

120
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,171
- Girls never asked you to use condoms?
- No.

121
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,215
What do you do?

122
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,178
I do what I'm told.

123
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,891
We always use condoms.

124
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,267
Do we?

125
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,478
Yeah. We used one last night.

126
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,813
Oh, yeah, I guess we do.

127
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,648
That's probably why
it takes me 25 years to nut

128
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:57,941
whenever I have sex with you.

129
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,277
Hey.

130
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,615
Oh, you're totally freaking out right now.

131
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,700
You have a total-freak-out face.

132
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,244
- I'm not freaking out right now.
- Yes, you are.

133
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,538
How would you even know
what I look like freaking out?

134
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,956
You've never seen me freak out.

135
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,124
It's okay.

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,168
I'm totally fine,

137
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,378
okay?

138
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,755
And you're totally pretty.

139
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,133
- Okay.
- Stop trying to kiss me.

140
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,345
Stop trying to kiss... okay.
I'll see you later.

141
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:39,441
If you tell me what I am doing,
then I will immediately stop doing it.

142
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,150
That's the point.

143
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,319
You shouldn't stop doing something
just because I tell you to.

144
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,488
You should be able to just be yourself.

145
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,782
But it seems like myself is
making you very frustrated.

146
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,866
Who cares, Charlie?

147
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,868
You should just be able
to go about your business,

148
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,954
piss me off, and not give a fuck.

149
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,830
That's what men do.

150
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,502
It's like I don't even know how to

151
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,921
make love to you anymore.

152
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,507
Make love to me? You mean, fuck me?

153
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,385
It's like you want me to be like
some dude who just doesn't give a shit.

154
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,720
Like, "Oh, fucking suck it,

155
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,265
and then fucking lay down and take a nap."

156
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,310
"You want these fucking nuts
in your mouth?"

157
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,437
No, I don't want to suck on your nuts.

158
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,606
- Oh, come on. Really?
- No.

159
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,859
Have you seen your nuts?

160
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,404
Like, I know you're joking,
but that's not funny to be like, "ew."

161
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,159
I never get used to those stairs.

162
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,704
We'll talk about it later.
Have a great day, ladies.

163
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,913
Oh, I mean, sluts.

164
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,498
You're a slut.

165
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,668
What?

166
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,046
- I'm sorry about him.
- No sweat off my back.

167
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,798
- What's going on?
- Oh, my god.

168
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:47,342
I mean, he's so busy
respecting me, you know,

169
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:51,555
that he looks right past me
and everything that I need from him.

170
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,184
Okay, you are a 23-year-old girl who's had
the same boyfriend for four years,

171
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,059
so, you're also allowed to be bored.

172
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,644
That's an okay excuse, too.

173
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,481
That is a really simplistic explanation
for what's going on.

174
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,941
I'm sorry if I minimized it.

175
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,403
I'm just unwilling to accept the idea
that you have too great a boyfriend.

176
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,697
Although, if you want someone
to feed you abusive rhetoric,

177
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,073
just send him
to Adam's house for the night.

178
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,993
- He'll learn a lot.
- Oh, more hooker stuff?

179
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,080
Hooker stuff, daddy stuff...
a combination... a platter of stuff.

180
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,210
Hannah, Adam cannot do that to you.

181
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,671
He can't. He's not allowed.
He's not your boyfriend.

182
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,508
Hello, Kwartler Gallery.
This is Marnie speaking.

183
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,635
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hey. What's up?

184
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,263
Oh, nothing. Actually,
I was just wondering if maybe...

185
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,349
No big deal, but you could get me
an appointment for this afternoon, too?

186
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,935
- Why?
<i>- Oh, you know, for an STD test.</i>

187
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,603
I mean, since we're going
to be there anyway.

188
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,022
And it's like, I'm going to be there.
You're going to be there.

189
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,149
I mean, maybe we both get them.
Maybe we all get them.

190
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,652
No. Thank you, though.

191
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,362
Well, when's the last time you did that?

192
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,490
Well, Charlie's been tested twice
since we've been together,

193
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,534
- so I figure that's--
- Not the same thing.

194
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,327
I mean, I've only had sex
with two and a half men,

195
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,079
and I'm going to start doing it
every few months, I think,

196
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,080
just to be responsible.

197
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,876
You were just bragging to me
about how you always use condoms.

198
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,502
Julian, stop listening.

199
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,839
I mean, if that's true,
then don't you think

200
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,507
you probably don't have anything?

201
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,425
Yeah, but what about the stuff

202
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,093
that gets up around
the sides of condoms, okay?

203
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,220
What about that stuff?
Have you thought about that stuff?

204
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,557
Okay, crazy one,
I'll schedule you an appointment.

205
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,983
So, this guy's making you bananas?

206
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,194
I've never experienced anything like it.

207
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,738
The thing is I have absolutely no sense
of how he really feels about me

208
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,450
because when we are together,
he's so there and he's so present.

209
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,078
And then, he disappears for two weeks
and doesn't answer any text messages,

210
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,164
and I feel as though I invented him.

211
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,166
Did you invent him?

212
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,252
If I'd invented him, then I wouldn't have
a giant bruise on my ass.

213
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,378
Pause.

214
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,881
I have something to contribute here.

215
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,553
"Listen, Ladies:

216
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,889
A Tough Love Approach
to the Tough Game of Love."

217
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,683
Okay, I'm going to admit
that I have hate-read that book.

218
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:42,601
Oh, my god.

219
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,728
It, like, totally changes
your perspective, right?

220
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,148
Okay, "If a man doesn't
take you on a date,

221
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,317
he's not interested, point-blank.

222
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:53,111
'Let's meet up with friends'
is not a date,

223
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,698
it's a date for him to decide
whether you're truly good enough to date,

224
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,325
and that's unacceptable, ladies."

225
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,077
There have to be exceptions to that rule.

226
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,372
"Sex from behind is degrading,
point-blank.

227
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,416
You deserve someone who wants to look
in your beautiful face, ladies."

228
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,877
What if I want to focus on something else?

229
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,755
What if I want to feel like I have udders?

230
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,882
This woman doesn't care about what I want.

231
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,843
But here's my question.

232
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,762
Who are "the ladies"?

233
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,889
Obvi... we're "the ladies."

234
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,224
I'm not "the ladies."

235
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,852
Yeah, you're "the ladies."

236
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,854
I'm not "the ladies."

237
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,314
Yes, you are. You're "the ladies."

238
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,234
You're being unfair.
You can't force me to be a lady.

239
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,821
I'm not forcing you to be a lady.
You just... Okay, I'm a lady,

240
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,906
she's a lady, you're a lady,

241
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,324
we're the ladies.

242
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,286
Fuck that silly little fucking book.

243
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,579
I told you. I just read it

244
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:46,164
in a weird moment of desperation
at the Detroit airport.

245
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,000
How could you even
finish a book like that?

246
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,086
That book is so idiotic,
I couldn't even read it on a toilet.

247
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,504
It might be pink and cheesy,

248
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,548
but there's actually
some very real wisdom in there

249
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,176
- about how to deal with men and--
- That woman is a horrible lady.

250
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,303
Why is this bothering you so much?

251
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,388
I'm offended by all the supposed to's.

252
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,223
I don't like women telling other women

253
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,726
what to do or how to do it
or when to do it.

254
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,811
Every time I have sex, it's my choice.

255
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,313
- Yeah
- and if I wanted to go on some dates,

256
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,230
I would.

257
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,150
But I don't, because they're for lesbians.

258
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,194
Are you okay?

259
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,322
What is wrong?

260
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,075
I mean, I know what is wrong,
but how is it wrong?

261
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:25,913
Are you scared?

262
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,164
No.

263
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,250
- Are you angry?
- Who would I be angry at?

264
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,129
- Maybe you're a little angry at yourself.
- No!

265
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,674
- So, are you angry at me?
- You are so self-involved.

266
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:38,967
Are you sad?

267
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,844
I am not a character
for one of your novels.

268
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,013
Stop staring at my face so hard.

269
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,641
Fine, okay.

270
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,018
And also, I write essays, so...

271
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,605
You know, I want to have children.

272
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:53,815
I really want to have children.

273
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,776
Yeah, of course, you do.

274
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,321
And you will have children at a time
when your life is actually set up--

275
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm going to be amazing at it.
I'm going to be really good.

276
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,079
I know that you are.
I've never doubted that for a second.

277
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:11,041
And I want to have children with
many different men of different races.

278
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,628
So, I have this job interview,

279
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,630
and I'm going to meet you there at one.

280
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,298
I love you, okay?

281
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,800
That's okay.

282
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,648
This, you know,
I mean, the truth is, it's pretty boring

283
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,400
and we're just like a trade journal.

284
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,361
No. My god, I mean,
I would be so excited to work here.

285
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,198
And I'm also, I should say,
responsible, decisive,

286
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:46,285
and all the other qualities you're weirdly
allowed to name in a job interview.

287
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:50,497
Yeah. I think the only other place
that you're allowed to brag like that is

288
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,583
on your online dating profile.

289
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,960
- Not that I have one.
- Oh, no, of course not.

290
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,839
So, you live in Brooklyn?

291
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,466
- Is it Williamsburg?
- No, I live in Greenpoint.

292
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,384
You know, big difference,

293
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,760
- Williamsburg and Greenpoint.
- Oh, sure, yeah.

294
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:06,513
- Are you in Brooklyn or...
- Yeah, Cobble Hill.

295
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,307
 Oh, that's like grown-up Brooklyn.

296
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,935
Yeah, I'm like a real live grown-up.
Can't you tell?

297
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,606
So, in your neighborhood, do you
ever drink at that place Weather Up?

298
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,233
That's a little bit hip for my taste.

299
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:20,736
Are you kidding? You're very hip.
But I do object to any bar

300
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,363
- that calls its bartenders "mixologists."
- Exactly.

301
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,324
- And they wear tiny vests.
- I know.

302
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,491
If I'm going to drink
in your neighborhood,

303
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,993
- then I want to go to Washington Commons.
- Washington Commons!

304
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,245
- Oh, my god, I love that place.
- Hands down.

305
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,665
I like a bar
where the median age is about 55.

306
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:37,085
I like a bar where the average patron
would be described as "crotchety."

307
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,296
- Crotchety's good.
- Crotchety's great.

308
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,423
- Crotchety's undervalued.
- It's true.

309
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:44,134
In our modern society,
crotchety is undervalued.

310
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,012
So I should probably look at
your résumé as a formality.

311
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,348
- I'm totally fine if you don't, too.
- Yeah.

312
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,934
And so... yeah, this is great.

313
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,727
- This is really--
- Where did you go to school?

314
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,271
Oh, I just went...
I went to Syracuse, upstate.

315
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:58,398
- I have so many friends who went there.
- Yeah, me, too.

316
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:02,152
- Because you went there with them.
- Yeah, a few of them up there.

317
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,404
I read a statistic that said Syracuse has

318
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,324
the highest incidents
of date rape of any university.

319
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,745
Which weirdly went way down

320
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,580
the year that you graduate

321
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,672
That was just a joke,

322
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,424
because I was saying
that there was no more date rape

323
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,468
because they figured out who it was,

324
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,262
who was doing it, and it was you.

325
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:35,394
Maybe you're not used
to office environments like this,

326
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,982
but jokes about rape or race

327
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,401
or incest or any of that kind of stuff,

328
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,986
it's not office okay.

329
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,698
And so, I just don't think
this is going to work out right now,

330
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,284
but call us back.

331
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,703
Maybe six months,
eight months down the road,

332
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,454
and we'll stay in touch.

333
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,486
What can I get you?

334
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,072
What time is it?

335
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,409
It's one o'clock.

336
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,621
These things never start on time.

337
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,831
- I'll have a white Russian, please.
- All right.

338
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,673
I am really sorry, okay?

339
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,467
- I'm sorry.
- You are ten minutes late.

340
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,928
- I'm eight minutes late.
- You're ten minutes late.

341
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,846
- Okay, well, where's Jessa?
- Well, she's not here,

342
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,015
because she's never fucking here
when she needs to be.

343
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,309
- Sorry.
- Well, she was really upset before.

344
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,936
I think you should be
a little bit sensitive.

345
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,771
I mean, you think?
She's about to get an abortion.

346
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,649
It's about the most traumatic thing
that can ever happen to a woman.

347
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,068
I'm telling you. I don't know why
you're being so casual about this.

348
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,862
I mean, I was getting really, really
worked up on the train on the way here.

349
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,532
You don't need to worry about her, okay?
This office is beautiful.

350
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,617
I'm sure they've done this
a million times before.

351
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,701
I was just thinking.

352
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,371
I have been sexually irresponsible
enough in my life thus far

353
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,040
that I should've gotten pregnant
by now, and I never have.

354
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,708
Like, I get my period at the same time,

355
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,546
on the same day
of every monthly cycle my entire life.

356
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,130
Like, it's never strayed from that.

357
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,090
Then you're really lucky.

358
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,801
I never know when I'm going to get
my period, and it's always a surprise.

359
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,136
And that's why all my underwear
are covered in weird stains.

360
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,223
Seriously, I need to become a mom, Hannah.

361
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,559
I was put on this planet to be a mother.

362
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,435
Well, maybe Charlie has
a really low sperm count.

363
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,521
I'm sure Charlie has
a really low sperm count.

364
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,606
What if I'm barren?

365
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,568
- No, you're not barren.
- Hi!

366
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:50,153
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I stopped at Dylan's and got some snacks

367
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,280
because I don't know
how long these things take.

368
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,823
When my sister had a baby,
it was like hours,

369
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,450
and I was like starving,
so, you know, I was just...

370
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,204
Shoshanna, you should sit down.

371
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,040
So you know Venice is sinking.

372
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,501
So I'm like, "We got to get out of here.
We got to move.

373
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,296
This place is going down.
It's happening faster than you think."

374
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,839
Nobody fucking moves.

375
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,841
I was like, "Are you guys crazy?".

376
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,551
Hey, do you guys have a pay phone?

377
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,261
Why would we have a pay phone?

378
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,097
Here, you can use my cellular phone.

379
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,265
Oh, thank you.

380
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,936
- You have a bunch of texts and stuff.
- Mind your own business.

381
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,446
Hey, Mom, it's Morgan.

382
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,283
Just calling to let you know
I will call you back in a few hours,

383
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,869
and I hope you're feeling better.

384
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,121
Love you. Bye.

385
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:43,832
Thank you.

386
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:44,958
Sure.

387
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,504
What's that you're drinking?

388
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,713
Milk.

389
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,177
Jessa, it's Marnie.

390
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,471
It is 1:30,
and your appointment was at one.

391
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:00,182
So call me, please. Bye.

392
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,019
Hey, a little bird told me

393
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,563
that you were getting an STD test. Fun!

394
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,399
Do you really think
that sounds like a lot of fun?

395
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,863
I mean, like, just to get to have sex
and then have a test about it?

396
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,367
This thing asks you if you wear
a seat belt and if you operate machinery.

397
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,536
Those are important things
if you're going to have a baby.

398
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,163
You need to wear a seat belt
and stop operating machinery.

399
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,748
She's obsessed with getting AIDS.

400
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,834
She thought she was going to
have it since she was ten years old.

401
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,043
So that's what this is about.

402
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,503
I don't have an obsessive fear of AIDS.

403
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,547
I have an obsessive fear of HIV
that turns into AIDS.

404
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,799
- I'm not a fool.
- Well, you don't have HIV.

405
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,009
You just don't.
It's not that easy to contract.

406
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,761
It's really not that hard
to contract either, though,

407
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,264
- like, haven't you seen<i> Rent</i>?
- Please, I've seen it 12 times.

408
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,015
It's basically why I moved to New York.

409
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,434
So use condoms if you're so scared.

410
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,270
I do use condoms. I always use condoms.

411
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:49,398
But what about all the stuff
that gets up around the sides of condoms?

412
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,941
What about that stuff?

413
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,734
Like what? What kind of stuff?

414
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:57,447
Okay, so when a guy finishes,
there's the material, okay?

415
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,533
- Right.
- And then, that stuff

416
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,535
can leak out from around
the sides of condoms.

417
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,744
And here's how I figure it.

418
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,831
He will leave his penis in you
from when it's hard to when it shrinks,

419
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,583
because that is what guys are wont to do.

420
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:09,209
Are they really wont to do that?

421
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,922
I mean, yeah, like, with me,
they're totally wont to do that.

422
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,424
Yeah, they usually do that.

423
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,468
And then, when they pull out,
it's fucking mayhem.

424
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,846
I've been diagramming it
in my head all afternoon.

425
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,306
And no one speaks about this.

426
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,932
Hannah Horvath.

427
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,851
Okay, that is me.

428
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:29,188
Please, don't yell at Jessa too much
when she gets here, okay?

429
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,231
I won't. I mean, it's just...

430
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,984
it's a bummer because, like,
she ruined it, but it's not--

431
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,029
How could she ruin
the beautiful abortion that you threw?

432
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,822
Hannah, that is not what I meant.

433
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,867
You're a really good friend,
and you threw a really good abortion.

434
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,035
Oh, stop it.

435
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:44,286
You did.

436
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,496
I'm just worried, you know?

437
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,166
What if she's in a gutter
or changed her mind?

438
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,544
She seemed really excited
about it this morning.

439
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,590
This is wild.

440
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,884
Put your hands down my pants.

441
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,968
- Now?
- Yes.

442
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:00,886
Okay.

443
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:03,931
Like that?

444
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,725
- Is that okay?
- Don't ask me that ever again in my life.

445
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:07,643
Sorry.

446
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:11,939
You're bleeding.

447
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:14,900
Oh, my god.

448
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:18,779
Oh, shit.

449
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,617
Jess-star, it's Shosh. It's like 2:15,

450
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,452
and I'm just calling to see where you are

451
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,288
-and how you're feeling and if you're--
-@

452
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,541
Hey, you're pregnant
when you don't want to be,

453
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,334
so you might want to come
have your abortion now.

454
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,460
Okay, thanks. Bye.

455
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,297
There is seriously
nothing flakier in this world

456
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,882
than not showing up to your own abortion.

457
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,635
I mean, honestly, can you think
of anything less respectful than that,

458
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,179
other than getting pregnant
in the first place?

459
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,806
Seriously, she should
just fucking, you know,

460
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,308
return our calls or something,
or at least send us a text.

461
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,353
She doesn't really know how to text.
She calls it a "word alert."

462
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,021
I mean, I don't even know
why I bother anymore.

463
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,774
I mean, honestly, every time
I put myself out there with her,

464
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:59,361
nothing, just brick wall.
She does not respect my time, my efforts,

465
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,738
my friendship, my kindness, none of it.

466
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:02,906
I mean, would you do this?

467
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,784
Would you get pregnant
after having sex with some weird foreigner

468
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:06,910
and then just not even show up

469
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,453
- to the abortion?
- I mean, I've never had sex.

470
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,622
What?

471
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,627
I've never had sex, okay?

472
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,214
AKA, I'm almost 22, and I'm a virgin.

473
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,759
Really?

474
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,595
- Seriously.
- Okay.

475
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,264
It's like everyone
and their mother has had sex except for me.

476
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:30,350
No, sex is really, really overrated.

477
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,269
What?

478
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,520
It is.

479
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,689
I mean, you've given a blow job, right?

480
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,150
- Yes.
- Yeah, so...

481
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,693
- No.
- Really?

482
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,029
Yes. I have not.

483
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,448
- You haven't?
- There was this one time at camp,

484
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,241
and it was a few strokes up and down,

485
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,536
but we were in the woods
and it was kind of spooky, so...

486
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,580
You think I'm a loser.

487
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,751
I don't think you're a loser.

488
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,836
I just told you that I'm a virgin.

489
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,588
- I don't--
- I don't know what to say.

490
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:03,300
I mean, I hit a puppy once with my car.

491
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,385
I only had my learner's permit.

492
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,644
Twenty-four years old?

493
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,815
- 145 pounds.
- Oh, I'm 143 pounds.

494
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,528
The nurse weighed me with clothes on,
so that was a rude thing to do.

495
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:24,905
Okay. Sexually active?

496
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,075
- Just one partner or...
- Should I get more?

497
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,369
Because the one I've got is
kind of a handful.

498
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:33,705
Yeah, it's just him.

499
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,917
And do you use protection? Condoms?

500
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,795
I always use condoms,
but I've been thinking a lot lately

501
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,005
about the stuff that gets up
around the sides of condoms.

502
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,174
Like, what is the deal
with all of that stuff, you know?

503
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,845
You mean, the semen?

504
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,179
I mean, all of it.

505
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,431
I mean,
I have a very bad fear of AIDS, so...

506
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,058
Have you known someone with AIDS?

507
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,561
It's more of like
a<i> Forrest Gump</i>-based fear.

508
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,105
That's what Robin Wright Penn's character
died of, so...

509
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,483
Okay, just lie back for me, okay?

510
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,569
Yeah. Just...

511
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,528
Yes, legs up.

512
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,864
Yeah. Oh, okay.

513
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:08,699
Perfect, thank you.

514
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,288
The thing is that these days,
if you are diagnosed with AIDS,

515
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,290
you know, it's actually,
it's not a death sentence.

516
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,084
There's so many good drugs
and people live a long time, so...

517
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,214
Also, you know, if you have AIDS,

518
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,216
there's a lot of stuff
people aren't going to bother you about,

519
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,427
like, you know, for example, no one's
going to call you on the phone and say,

520
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,220
"Did you get a job?"
or "Did you pay your rent?"

521
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:31,805
Or "Are you taking an HTML course?".

522
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:33,599
Because all they're going to say
is, like, you know,

523
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,893
"Congratulations on not being dead."

524
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:39,771
You know, it's also a really good excuse
to be mad at a guy.

525
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,440
It's not just something dumb
like, "you didn't text me."

526
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,483
It's like, "You gave me AIDS, so

527
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,904
deal with that forever."

528
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:50,365
Maybe I actually am not scared of AIDS.

529
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:53,118
Maybe I thought I was scared
of AIDS, and what I really am is

530
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,704
wanting AIDS.

531
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,713
That is an incredibly silly thing to say.

532
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,423
You do not want AIDS.

533
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:11,678
Do you know that every 35 minutes,
a woman is newly diagnosed with HIV?

534
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:15,182
And a third of those women are
under the age of 30,

535
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,434
and many of them will die of AIDS.

536
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,645
So, you're saying that
if Adam gave me AIDS,

537
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,688
that I'm definitely going to die of it?

538
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,899
No, I'm not saying that.

539
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,776
Can you open up, please?

540
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:31,031
You could not pay me enough
to be 24 again.

541
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,325
Well, they're not paying me at all.

542
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:38,205
Is that painful?

543
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,124
Yeah, but only in the way
it's supposed to be.

544
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,092
