1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,937
Will you two slow down?

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,980
You're eating like
they're going to take it away from you.

3
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,148
I'm a growing girl.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,113
It's such a pleasure seeing you
and seeing how well work is going.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,240
Work's going really well, yeah.

6
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,991
My boss said that he wants to see my book

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,451
when it's done, which is really exciting.

8
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,495
Where are you at with that?

9
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,789
Oh, well, I've done four of the essays,

10
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,249
and I'm just kind of polishing them up.

11
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,917
And my hope is that it's going to be nine.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,503
But, you know, it's a memoir.
So, have to live them first.

13
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,549
Tad, I don't want to just leave it
'til the end of dinner.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,758
I hear that.

15
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,597
Hannah, your mother
and I have been talking,

16
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,599
and we feel that it may be time...

17
00:00:58,851 --> 00:00:59,893
how can I phrase this?

18
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,937
Well, we see how well
you're doing at work.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,731
And you really seem to be
figuring out what it is that you want.

20
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,694
But it may be time for one final push.

21
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,946
What is a "final push"?

22
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,156
We're not going to be
supporting you any longer.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,825
You see, I wasn't going to
phrase it like that, Loreen,

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,952
-the way you phrased it.
-But I have no job.

25
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,539
No, you have an internship
that you say is going to turn into a job.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,915
I don't know when.

27
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,168
You graduated from college two years ago.

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,004
We've been supporting you
for two years, and that's enough.

29
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,258
Do you know how crazy
the economy is right now?

30
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,968
I mean, all my friends
get help from their parents.

31
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,636
We are sympathetic to that.

32
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,222
But I'm your only child.

33
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,057
It's not like I'm draining
all your resources.

34
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,726
I mean, this feels very arbitrary.

35
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,103
You don't know anything
about our finances.

36
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:46,315
We're professors, Hannah. Professors.

37
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,693
We can't keep bankrolling
your groovy lifestyle.

38
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,945
My "groovy" lifestyle?

39
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,406
The bills add up.
We're covering your rent,

40
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,241
your insurance, your cell phone.

41
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,869
You said it was cheaper for you
if I was on the family plan.

42
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,786
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,122
May I get you more of anything?

44
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,041
No, she's fine.

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,877
-Delicious.
-Yeah.

46
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,547
This is nuts.

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,758
Ted, can you help me here?

48
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,677
I could be a drug addict.
Do you realize how lucky you are?

49
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,054
I mean, it doesn't have to be heroin,

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,014
it could be something
more insidious, like pills.

51
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,892
Which are legal,
and which a lot of kids do, all the time.

52
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,270
And then slowly,
they become totally useless.

53
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:28,023
They seem really high-functioning,
and then it just ruins them.

54
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,359
Okay, my friend Sophie,
her parents don't support her.

55
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,319
Last summer, she had two abortions

56
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,030
right in a row, and no one came with her.

57
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,074
What does that have to do with anything?

58
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm just saying that
I am so close to the life that I want,

59
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,497
the life that you want for me,
that for you to just end that right now?

60
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,124
No more money.

61
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,462
-Starting when?
-Starting now.

62
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,840
We can talk about it tomorrow.

63
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,132
I don't want to see you tomorrow.

64
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,051
-What?
-But we fly out Tuesday.

65
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,054
I have work,
and then I have a dinner thing,

66
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,597
and then I am busy

67
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,766
trying to become who I am.

68
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,050
Alarm.

69
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:37,968
What?

70
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,060
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

71
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,529
Miss? You are here.

72
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,324
Already?

73
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,541
Good morning, Charlie.

74
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,835
Why didn't you wake me up?

75
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,295
I didn't mean to sleep with Hannah.

76
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,380
Because you two looked so angelic.

77
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,342
Victoria's secret angel, fat baby angel.

78
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,261
-Don't say that.
-No way, you look awesome these days.

79
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,347
Please avert your eyes.

80
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:26,767
Is that a present?

81
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,393
Is that for me?

82
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,064
-Give it here.
-Thank you.

83
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,191
You guys fell asleep
to Mary Tyler Moore again, huh?

84
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,652
Yes, guilty.

85
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,695
It's a very odd show
to hear through a wall.

86
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:39,988
Coming at ya.

87
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:41,782
Here it comes.

88
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,450
Pow!

89
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,245
I just blew up a kiss on you.

90
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,457
-Are you going to leave your towel on?
-Yes.

91
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,835
But I never see you naked,
and you always see me naked.

92
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,419
When it should actually
be the other way around.

93
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,672
-You are beautiful, shut up.
-I don't need that.

94
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,049
-I need to see your boobs.
-Well, you don't get to, sorry.

95
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,093
I only show my boobs
to people I'm having sex with.

96
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,428
You literally slept
in my bed to avoid him.

97
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,471
I know.

98
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,765
Hannah, I’ve turned a corner.

99
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,268
His touch now feels like

100
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,646
a weird uncle just putting
his hand on my knee at Thanksgiving.

101
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,064
What are you going to do?

102
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,775
-I think I have to end it.
-You can't do that.

103
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,901
I have to. Why not?

104
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,445
'Cause he'll stand
outside our window with a boom box

105
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,739
-or he'll kill himself.
-Stop.

106
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:23,657
Hey, babe.

107
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,159
Sorry. I thought it was
just my girlfriend in here.

108
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,828
Dude, it's never just
your girlfriend in here.

109
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,954
I'm just saying goodbye.

110
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,998
I'll see you ladies tonight,
and I'll pick up wine.

111
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
Okay, big kisses.

112
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,251
Bye.

113
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,963
What does it even feel like
to be loved that much?

114
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,090
I don't know. I can't feel it anymore.

115
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh, no.

116
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,885
I know, I just...

117
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,763
And it makes me feel like such a bitch
'cause I can feel him being so nice to me.

118
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,391
And yet it makes me so angry.

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,185
I think you need to
admit something to yourself,

120
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,978
which is that you're sick
of eating him out.

121
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,731
'Cause he has a vagina.

122
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,204
-Hi.<i> Ca va?</i>
-<i>Bonjour</i>, roomie.

123
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,788
Oh, my god. You're so hip, I could puke.

124
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,499
I can never pull off that hat.
How do you pull off that hat?

125
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,627
I love your jumper.

126
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,922
Your skin is, like, hauntingly beautiful.

127
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,382
-Can I put my bags down?
-What?

128
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,134
Oh, my god, of course.

129
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,261
You're like my favorite cousin.

130
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,514
I'm the only one of my girlfriends
that has a British cousin.

131
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,390
Well, how long do you think
you're going to stay for?

132
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,475
I mean, not that I'm asking you to leave.

133
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,809
You can totally stay forever
if you want to.

134
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,521
-Can I have something to eat?
-Yeah.

135
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,773
You've been interning there for a year.

136
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,108
You need to tell them
it's time to get paid.

137
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,985
Costs a lot of money to look this cheap.

138
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,364
This is not a joke. If you can't
afford to pay your half of the rent,

139
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,366
Charlie is going to move in here.

140
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,743
-You're dumping Charlie.
-I didn't say that.

141
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,747
So I texted Adam about tonight,
and I have not heard anything back.

142
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,998
Hannah, look at me.

143
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,417
He never, ever texts you back.

144
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,627
Maybe I should call him.

145
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,255
I mean, didn't you say texting's like
the lowest form of communication

146
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,298
-on the pillar of chat?
-The totem of chat,

147
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,092
and no, the lowest,
that would be Facebook,

148
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,511
followed by gChat, then texting,

149
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,137
-then email, then phone.
-Got you.

150
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,890
Face-to-face is, of course, ideal.
But it's not of this time.

151
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,934
Okay, but then how am I
supposed to get him face-to-face

152
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,727
if he refuses to text me?

153
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,356
Think Jessa will really appreciate
the welcome-home dinner.

154
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,233
It's a very friendish thing of us to do.

155
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,527
What?

156
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,195
I just know she's going to show up late,

157
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,239
wearing some fabulous blankety dress

158
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,199
from a Grecian marketplace and be like,

159
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,993
"Oh, I can't remember where I got this."

160
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm really glad that she's coming home.

161
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,830
But every time she comes into town,

162
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,415
you go on some week-long bender,

163
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,250
and then she leaves
to go off to her next country

164
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,960
and I'm left to pick up the pieces.

165
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,837
Okay, it is so rare that I say this,

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,338
but I just think she's fun.

167
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,799
Yeah, it was really fun
when she fucked Carolyn’s boyfriend.

168
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,259
She didn't fuck your boyfriend.

169
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,969
That's 'cause he was
in Prague that semester.

170
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:49,887
Thanks so much.

171
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,181
It's a great deal for Nolita.

172
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,558
I mean 2,100 a month? Amaze.

173
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,351
It's a little more expensive
than the dorms,

174
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,687
but Aunt Ilene thinks
it's like the perfect bachelorette pad.

175
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,605
I mean...

176
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,941
Do you like the poster?

177
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,361
Oh, you know, I've never seen that movie.

178
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,572
-Only the show?
-Is it a show?

179
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,115
Oh, my god. You're not serious.

180
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,118
I mean, that's like not being on Facebook.

181
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,955
-I'm not on Facebook.
-You're so fucking classy.

182
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,375
You know, you're funny
because you're definitely like a Carrie

183
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,254
but with, like, some Samantha aspects
and Charlotte hair.

184
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,174
-That's like a really good combination.
-Oh, thank you.

185
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,260
I think I'm definitely a Carrie at heart,

186
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,678
but, like, sometimes...

187
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,348
sometimes Samantha kind of comes out.

188
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,349
And then, I mean, when I’m a school,

189
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,184
I definitely try
and put on my Miranda hat.

190
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,936
Where were you before France?

191
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,065
Before France, I was in Amsterdam...

192
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,274
No, I was in Bali,

193
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,443
and I was shucking pearls there.

194
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,070
And then I met a surfer--

195
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,988
Oh, my god. Did he really like you?

196
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,950
-He really liked you, right?
-Yeah, he really liked me.

197
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,006
-Hannah?
-Hello, Alistair.

198
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:10,926
Hello.

199
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,012
You seem eager.

200
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,807
As you know,
I've been working here for over a year.

201
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,350
Has it been that long?

202
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,145
Well, you are an invaluable part
of our operation.

203
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,565
Which I recently learned
means very valuable

204
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,275
as opposed to not at all valuable.

205
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,902
And I wanted to let you know
that my circumstances have changed

206
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,321
and I can no longer afford
to work for free.

207
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,031
Oh, Hannah.

208
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,534
I am so sorry to lose you.

209
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,245
I was just going to
start you manning our Twitter,

210
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,163
you have just the quippy voice for that.

211
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,915
Oh, no, I'm not quitting.

212
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,711
I just... I know that Joy-Lynn
got hired after interning,

213
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,379
-so I thought that maybe--
- Hannah.

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,631
Joy-Lynn knows Photoshop.

215
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,383
Now, in this economy,

216
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,761
do you know how many
internship requests I get every day?

217
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,181
-I would assume a lot.
-Fifty, it's about fifty.

218
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,516
I practically route them
into my spam folders.

219
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,270
So, if you think you have
just nothing left to learn from us...

220
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,314
No, it is not that, really.

221
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,357
I just, you know, got to eat.

222
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,402
Well, when you get hungry enough,

223
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,362
you're going to figure it out.

224
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:16,158
Do you mean like
physically hungry or hungry for the job?

225
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,329
I am really going to miss your energy.

226
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,623
I think this is going to be
really good for you.

227
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,338
You mentioned that
when I was finished with my book,

228
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,589
I could send it to you.

229
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,384
Well, we wouldn't have you here

230
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,970
to read it for us. Would we?

231
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,188
Where are you going?

232
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,232
Will you get me a Luna Bar?

233
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,817
And a Smart water and Vitamin water?

234
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,118
Yo, hey.

235
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,579
Yeah, no, I'm actually
just leaving a friend's house

236
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,082
that's, like, right by your house, so...

237
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:07,918
Yeah?

238
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,257
-Hey, doll.
-Hey.

239
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,134
"Doll," that is what my dad calls me.

240
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,846
Yeah, I know. He told me.
We're in the same circle jerk.

241
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,392
-I just had the worst ever day.
-You were nearby?

242
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:24,935
Why?

243
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,480
I got fired from my job, so...

244
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:30,566
Weren't you an intern?

245
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,193
Well, I was working there for a while

246
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,361
-so I was technically an intern.
-So basically,

247
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
they just asked you
to not hang out there anymore?

248
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,448
When I was walking over here--

249
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,953
Funny. I was on my way
over here and I was panicking,

250
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,621
but then it occurred to me,
like, I'm an English major,

251
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,248
-there has to be some kind of--
- Major doesn't matter.

252
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,250
I was comp lit and it hasn't done shit.

253
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,336
Yeah, but you're an actor, so aren't you
always comparing different literature?

254
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,047
I don't know.

255
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,553
Plus, I'm into this woodworking stuff.
It's just more honest.

256
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,264
Yeah, it all looks awesome.
But what about your play?

257
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,474
Yeah, we're not doing it.
That guy's a dick.

258
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,643
Can I sit down?

259
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:07,978
Yeah.

260
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,281
So, if I tell you something,
will you promise that you won't judge me?

261
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:21,283
Yes.

262
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,037
'Til yesterday, I got all
of my money from my parents.

263
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,163
Okay.

264
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,374
Does that make you feel sick?
Make you not want to talk to me?

265
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,878
No, I mean I wouldn't take shit
from my parents. They're buffoons.

266
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,422
But my grandma gives me
800 dollars a month.

267
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,302
So is, like, that
how you support yourself or...

268
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,263
Yeah. I mean, I supplement.

269
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,391
But it gives me the freedom
that I don't have to be anyone's slave.

270
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,062
You should never be
anyone's fucking slave.

271
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:51,897
Except mine.

272
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,862
You're feeling pretty frisky.

273
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,281
I really despise that word.
I hate it so much.

274
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,500
I like you so much.
I don't know where you disappear to.

275
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,670
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

276
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,927
It's so funny that it's still light out,

277
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,137
but it's getting dark
a lot earlier these days.

278
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,932
-Is this some of your poetry?
-Don't be a jerk.

279
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,267
Who, me?

280
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,396
Do you know that part on your resume

281
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,648
where they ask you to list
all of your special skills?

282
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,525
I haven't applied for a job
in a long fucking time.

283
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,819
Okay, well, it's the thing
where they ask you to list, like,

284
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,573
yoga, Spanish, waterskiing, Photoshop.

285
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,575
I feel like I--

286
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,119
don't have any special skills.

287
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,913
-I have something you can do.
-What?

288
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,375
But first, I have to see
if you fulfill all the requirements.

289
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,043
What are the requirements?

290
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,253
Lie on your stomach.

291
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,298
-Now?
-Yes, now. Wait.

292
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,347
You modern career woman,
I know what you like.

293
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,391
You think you can just come in here

294
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,268
and talk all that noise?

295
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,854
Now?

296
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,981
Grab your legs.

297
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,154
-Just... what did you say?
-Grab your legs.

298
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,405
Okay.

299
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,616
Okay, this is good.

300
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,952
-I'm going to go get some lube.
-Why do we need to get lube?

301
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,789
When I get back, I want you
in the exact same position,

302
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,125
but take all the rest of the shit off.

303
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,668
Will you get a condom?

304
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,129
I'll consider it.

305
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,441
Jesus fucking Christ.

306
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,735
This is really hard.

307
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,960
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

308
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,838
-You putting on a condom?
-No!

309
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,464
-Wait, you are, right?
-Yes.

310
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,007
Okay, 'cause when you said
the thing about lube,

311
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,551
I was worried you were going to try to

312
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,761
do that. Please don't do that.

313
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,721
That feels awful. Thank you.

314
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:33,100
-It's all right.
-Okay. Thank you.

315
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,852
That's the right spot.

316
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,728
Yeah, sorry.

317
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,772
So I can just stay like this
for a little while?

318
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:39,690
Yeah.

319
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,776
-Do you need me to move more?
-What?

320
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,696
I just didn't know if you wanted me
to be more like... like that.

321
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,489
Oh, no. This is fine. You're doing great.

322
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:48,699
This is all you need to do.

323
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,534
I'm sorry about the wrong hole thing.

324
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,703
I just... I don't want to do it now,

325
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,496
and, like, if we did,
I'd just want to talk about it

326
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,082
and just figure out what...
it's just not comfortable for me--

327
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,585
-Let's play the quiet game.
-So you're not mad at me?

328
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,794
No, I'm great.

329
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,838
A great time.

330
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,174
<i>You know what would be crazy?</i>

331
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,259
<i>-What would be crazy?</i>
<i>-Like if we...</i>

332
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,971
just got crazy, right here right now.

333
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,097
We could just do that.

334
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,975
I mean, nobody's stopping us.
Nobody's home.

335
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,561
What would turn you on the most right now?

336
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,022
What would turn me on the most?

337
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,609
What would turn you on the most?

338
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,528
To turn you on,
that's what would turn me on.

339
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,780
-Let me do that.
-Okay.

340
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,703
What if you were a stranger?

341
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,497
-Oh, yeah, a stranger.
-Right? What if...

342
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,583
What if you were just like
a totally different person?

343
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,169
You didn't act like you?

344
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,884
I think Jessa's here.

345
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,470
-Oh, no. I think that might be Ray.
-You invited Ray?

346
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,180
It was going to be
like a four-person party.

347
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,473
That's called dinner.

348
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,352
Gosh, I'm sorry.

349
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,312
What's with all the tattoos?

350
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,563
What do you mean?

351
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,566
Why'd you do all of them?

352
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,778
They're illustrations
from children's books mostly.

353
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,537
Even the one on your ass?

354
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,332
No. That one, my friend Jessa did
sophomore year with a safety pin.

355
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a snake wrapped around the moon.

356
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,710
When did you do that?

357
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,547
I did them mostly in high school.

358
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,715
Why?

359
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,470
Truthfully? I gained
a bunch of weight very quickly,

360
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,472
and I just felt
very out of control of my own body,

361
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,932
and it was just like
I had the idea of like,

362
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,059
"I'm taking control of my own shape."

363
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,524
-You know, I was fat in high school.
-Really?

364
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,734
Yeah, but I didn't go
drawing all over myself.

365
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,364
You're not that fat anymore.
You can just have them lasered off.

366
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,623
What time is it?

367
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,420
Five o’clock.

368
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,046
What time is it?

369
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,507
Nine forty five.

370
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,218
I am so late for this dinner thing.

371
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:14,887
Fuck.

372
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,347
Seriously, this was really, really nice.

373
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,932
It was really good to see you.

374
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm glad. Thanks for coming.

375
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,687
It made me feel a lot better, so...

376
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,315
I'll see you soon?

377
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,567
Yeah, just text me.

378
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,620
It's not like they're commandments,
but generally speaking,

379
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,372
as a general rule, I try not to
date women that are under 25

380
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,792
or that have been, at one point
in their life, penetrated by a drummer.

381
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,252
-One time!
-Guilty of both.

382
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,795
But I was walking through
the mall this morning,

383
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,716
I just see these two huge green orbs
bobbing through the mall.

384
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,717
I mean, look at these eyes!

385
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,718
-Have you seen these eyes?
-They're my eyes!

386
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,261
-He's so nice to me.
-Ridiculous.

387
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,056
Look at those lashes, too.
Have you seen these lashes?

388
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,475
-Guilty as charged.
-So cute.

389
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,895
-You okay?
-Yeah.

390
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,064
I just can't believe
Hannah didn't show up.

391
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,067
We're here. Living it up. Partying down.

392
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,111
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm just not really into eating this week.

393
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,531
Hannah was the one
saying this was our big reunion

394
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,449
and now she's nowhere to be found.

395
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,535
Are you worried?
I mean, should we call someone?

396
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,912
No, especially because
I know exactly where she is.

397
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,748
She's off having gross sex
with that animal.

398
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,708
In what way gross?

399
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,628
Charlie would like to
at least hear about some sex.

400
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:30,546
Excuse me?

401
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,674
Ray's just being,
you know, like motivational.

402
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,051
I mean, come on, at least you didn't
have to entertain Jessa on her own.

403
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,928
Yeah, 'cause I didn't
get to entertain anybody

404
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,096
because no one came.

405
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,974
-Hannah! Marnie!
-Who's that? She sounds British.

406
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,476
Oh, I ordered a few hookers,
if you guys don't mind.

407
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,395
Bulgarian girls. Top-shelf.

408
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,356
-Nice girls.
-He kills me. I swear to god.

409
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,524
Marnie!

410
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,778
Top lock!

411
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,873
Paris is really where you should be.

412
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,666
If you're a francophile like...

413
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,169
-Me and you, obviously.
-Yeah.

414
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,255
-Then you've got to go to France.
-You have to go.

415
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,008
I was a live-in educator
for these three children,

416
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,342
and they all sang.

417
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,345
And their father
was a brilliant pacifist thinker.

418
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,306
Isn't that the plot to<i> The Sound of Music</i>?

419
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,767
-It is.
-We really want to travel more.

420
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,686
-We could just go.
-Up and go.

421
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,688
I am so sorry I'm so late.

422
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,523
-Hannah banana.
-Would you please come here

423
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,774
-and talk to us?
-Hello.

424
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:35,485
You're here. You're here. Hi.

425
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,530
What's going on? You look beautiful.

426
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,992
-What'd you say?
-What's going on?

427
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,205
-She smells like sex.
-No, but you showered this morning.

428
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,749
So I calculated,
and I can last in New York

429
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,250
for three and a half more days.

430
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,002
Maybe seven if I don't eat lunch.

431
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,713
I'm going to find you a job
worthy of your talents.

432
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,465
Well, I appreciate that,

433
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,300
but I don't know how you're going to
find a job fast enough.

434
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,010
I'm going to have
to work at, like, McDonald's.

435
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,637
You're not going to work at McDonald's.

436
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,430
What's wrong with McDonald's?
You should work at McDonald's.

437
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,517
It's great. It's fucking incredible.

438
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,435
You know how many people
McDonald's feeds every day?

439
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,937
You know how many people
it employs around the world?

440
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,105
Plus, they make
an incredible product, okay?

441
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,774
It tastes tremendous.

442
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,734
It's affordable. It's fucking consistent.

443
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,819
I can walk into a McDonald's in Nigeria,

444
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:18,946
order chicken McNuggets.

445
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,114
When I bite into it,
you know what it's going to taste like?

446
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,282
It's going to taste like home.

447
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,493
It doesn't mean I have to work there.
I went to college.

448
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,286
Yeah, I went to college, too.
You know where it left me?

449
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,872
I have 50,000 dollars in student loans.

450
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,082
That's how deep in debt I am.

451
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,085
I'm sorry, but watching this,
this is like watching<i> Clueless</i>.

452
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,920
The movie or the TV show?

453
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,673
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing over there?

454
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,383
I'm making a little brew.

455
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,134
He's making a tea of opium pods.

456
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,595
Oh, cool. So you brought opium
into our apartment.

457
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,347
Well, yeah, this stuff's pretty mild.

458
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,724
This is much milder
than the stuff you'd smoke.

459
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,643
It's legal. I got it down
at the flower district.

460
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,186
You can just go there and buy the pods.

461
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,232
-Is it cool if I have a little?
-Knock yourself out.

462
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,443
-I hate opium.
-Oh, yeah, what's your thing? Coke?

463
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,987
No, I never do coke.

464
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,072
Every time I do coke, I shit my pants.

465
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,116
Oh, Jesus Christ.

466
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,742
-That's horrible.
-It happens.

467
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,120
-What does it taste like?
-It kind of tastes like twigs.

468
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,914
-Yeah, I'll have some.
-Maybe you shouldn't.

469
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,791
You're super sensitive to drugs.

470
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,960
I think I'm going to be fine, okay?
Hand it over.

471
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:16,378
It's hot.

472
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,633
Oh, Jesus.

473
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,094
This does not taste like Twix.

474
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:25,846
Not Twix, twigs.

475
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,347
Twigs, like small sticks.

476
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,814
If you're going to vanish,
you have to call, okay?

477
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,443
Yeah, okay. I want to go back in there.

478
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,486
No, you can't.
I need to talk to you first.

479
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,781
All you need to do
is talk to your parents, okay?

480
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,992
You need to ask them to support you

481
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:51,538
for a little itty-bit longer,
just while you look for another job.

482
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,957
And tell them that
you take your future seriously.

483
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,251
Because you do. You're Hannah.

484
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,421
-Does Charlie have a girlfriend?
-Yes.

485
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,591
Marnie was just saying that she feels
like I need to go and talk to my parents

486
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,010
and ask them to support me
until I get a job.

487
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,429
Why don't you just tell them
that you're an artist?

488
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,140
You just need to tell them
once and for all

489
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,184
-that you are an artist.
-Just tell them

490
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,020
you're going to get a job,
that's much more convincing.

491
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,190
Tell them you'll get tuberculosis
in a garret if you have to.

492
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,025
Tell them it's what Flaubert did.

493
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,320
Flaubert is not a good role model,
and have you met her parents?

494
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,280
She can't just do the artist thing.

495
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,865
Tell them that Picasso did it.

496
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:31,245
Rappers who were poor
and sold their tapes in the street did it.

497
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,248
It's what Elvis did.
It's what Mick Jagger did.

498
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,083
It's what my stepbrother did.

499
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,627
They all stuck to their guns.

500
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,670
I need to go.

501
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,173
You just drank an entire cup of opium.

502
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,259
You are gorgeous and a vision.

503
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:47,177
You are a brilliant genius.

504
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,805
Both of you are sex goddesses.

505
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,225
When I look at both of you,
a Coldplay song plays in my heart.

506
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,978
Bye.

507
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,024
God, she seems like
she's in such a good place.

508
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,903
<i>Mom? Papa?</i>

509
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,573
-I think that's Hannah.
-Did she just call me papa?

510
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,327
-Hi!
-Oh, hey.

511
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,328
What the heck are you doing here?

512
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:15,539
I thought you didn't
want to see us anymore.

513
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:21,420
Actually, I couldn't bear the idea
of not seeing you before you left town.

514
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,130
But more important...
Here, you can sit down.

515
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:24,339
It's late. I'm sorry.

516
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,635
is that I brought you my book.

517
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,220
I need you to read it.

518
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,307
Jesus, it's hot.

519
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,516
-Great. Yeah.
-That's fine.

520
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,559
Are you boiling?

521
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,394
Great, we'll read it on the plane.

522
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,396
No, now. I need you to read it now.

523
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,564
Because...

524
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,066
I don't want to freak you out,

525
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,988
but I think that I may be
the voice of my generation.

526
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,326
Or at lease a voice

527
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,411
of a generation.

528
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,247
Well, just read.
Don't be scared, just enjoy it

529
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,499
'cause there's going to be plenty
for us to talk about after.

530
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:00,501
Just go for it.

531
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:05,422
I need to talk to you.

532
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,590
All right.

533
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,344
I do not like
what just went down out there. At all.

534
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,261
What, with Hannah?

535
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,515
Yeah, I guess I just don't
understand the problem.

536
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,893
-She seemed ready.
-She had just gotten high.

537
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,063
I'd like for you
to see a real high person.

538
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,983
Marnie, you can't mother her like that.

539
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,362
I'm not mothering her. I'm literally
preventing a disaster from happening.

540
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,365
Have you even read her novel?

541
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,784
It's a memoir, and of course
I've read it, I'm her best friend.

542
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,786
Best friend. This is my best friend.

543
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,329
You know, we don't own anybody.

544
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,498
Maybe you don't respect
what a best friendship means

545
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,334
because you've never stayed
in one place long enough to have one.

546
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,586
Marnie, I can't help your feelings.

547
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,130
Maybe you can help being two hours late

548
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,675
to a dinner party that was thrown for you.

549
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,468
-My god! Yes.
-It was two hours?

550
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,178
-When was dinner?
-Seven!

551
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,931
Seven? I thought
that was just a suggestion.

552
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:59,059
A suggest... Okay, I'm sorry
we don't eat at one in the morning,

553
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,602
but we don't live in Barcelona.

554
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:03,272
Maybe not one, but ten, ten’s reasonable.

555
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,440
See, this is what you do.
You act like I'm uptight,

556
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:07,693
and then I follow suit. I become uptight.

557
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:09,903
It is the most frustrating dynamic
on the planet.

558
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,782
-It drives me crazy. I can't stand it.
-I'm fucking pregnant.

559
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:16,743
All right? I'm pregnant.

560
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,373
-On purpose?
-What do you think?

561
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,043
I have to tell you something, you two.

562
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,336
You guys are so beautiful.

563
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:32,176
Okay, all right.

564
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:35,679
That's a high person.

565
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,682
-This is very funny stuff, Loreen.
-Yeah.

566
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,727
-Hannah, you're a very funny girl.
-Thank you, papa.

567
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,191
-Okay.
-Oh.

568
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,445
All I am asking for to finish this book

569
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:54,781
is 1,100 dollars a month

570
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,366
for the next two years.

571
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,702
-That's insane.
-That's a chunk of change.

572
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,455
You would say it's insane.
Who can live in New York

573
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,789
on 1,100 dollars a month?

574
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,459
But I am so committed to this book

575
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,086
that I am willing
to get pretty thrifty on this.

576
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,423
Why don't you get a job and start a blog?

577
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,342
You are so spoiled.

578
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,344
Yeah, well, whose fault is that, Mom?

579
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,597
-Your father's.
-You know this is making me so unhappy.

580
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,017
-I'm having such a horrible feeling.
-Oh, we're not WaMu, Hannah.

581
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,144
And the least you can do
is sit up straight and...

582
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,062
Hannah?

583
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,732
Hannah, Jesus. Hannah?

584
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,485
I shouldn't have taken it,
but I was just having such a bad day.

585
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,402
Taken what? What did you take?

586
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,279
Is she sick, Tad?
Do I need to call a hospital?

587
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,697
I think she may be high.

588
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,241
-It's legal, like flowers.
-Oh, my god.

589
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,493
I'm not going to be angry, Hannah.
All right, I'm just really curious.

590
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,662
-What did you smoke?
-It's opium pods.

591
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,372
It's a tea of opium pods.

592
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,040
-We should Google that.
-I don't need to Google that.

593
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:47,960
I know about that.
It's tantamount to smoking banana peels.

594
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,711
For Christ's sake,
let's just order her a coffee.

595
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:50,754
Coffee's for grown-ups.

596
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,506
You're going to drink
a strong cup of coffee!

597
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:55,133
I'm 24 years old!
Don't tell me what to do.

598
00:27:55,217 --> 00:27:56,760
This is a real display.

599
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,846
No, this is the immediate result
of a cold approach.

600
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,055
You can't just pull the rug out

601
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,473
-from under her so suddenly.
-Why are you doing this?

602
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:02,641
We should stay a few more days.

603
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,227
Look, I admire your kind heart,
I really do.

604
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,980
But you're getting played
by a major fucking player!

605
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,315
I know! But it's hard
for me to watch her struggle!

606
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,025
My skirt feels so tight.

607
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,819
Maybe you can just cut it
open with a scissors?

608
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,362
It's like watching her get a shot!

609
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,323
-Shots keep people from getting sick!
-Well...

610
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,534
-I want a lake house. I work hard.
-I know.

611
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,452
I want to sit by a fucking lake.

612
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,079
-You deserve a lake.
-I'm going to die

613
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,373
like Flaubert in a garret.

614
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,458
Don't look at me.

615
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,313
Mom?

616
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:52,941
Dad?

617
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,327
Hi, I'm in room 2507,
and I wanted to get some room service.

618
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,291
But is the account totally closed
if they've checked out?

619
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:10,834
You can't add anything?

620
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,670
Okay, no. Yeah, got it.

621
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:15,339
I'm leaving right now. Thank you.

622
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,701
