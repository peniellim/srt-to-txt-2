1
Will you two slow down?

2
You're eating like
they're going to take it away from you.

3
I'm a growing girl.

4
It's such a pleasure seeing you
and seeing how well work is going.

5
Work's going really well, yeah.

6
My boss said that he wants to see my book
when it's done, which is really exciting.

7
Where are you at with that?

8
Oh, well, I've done four of the essays,

9
and I'm just kind of polishing them up.

10
And my hope is that it's going to be nine.

11
But you know, it's a memoir.
So, I have to live them first.

12
Tad, I don't want to just leave it
'til the end of dinner.

13
I hear that.

14
Hannah, your mother
and I have been talking,

15
and we feel that it may be time...

16
How can I phrase this?

17
Well, we see how well
you're doing at work,

18
and you really seem to be
figuring out what it is that you want.

19
But it may be time for one final push.

20
What is a "final push"?

21
We're not going to be
supporting you any longer.

22
You see, I wasn't going
to phrase it like that, Doreen,

23
- the way you phrased it.
- But I have no job.

24
No, you have an internship
that you say is going to turn into a job.

25
I don't know when.

26
You graduated from college two years ago.

27
We've been supporting you
for two years, and that's enough.

28
Do you know how crazy
the economy is right now?

29
I mean, all my friends
get help from their parents.

30
We are sympathetic to that.

31
But I'm your only child.

32
It's not like I'm draining
all your resources.

33
I mean, this feels very arbitrary.

34
You don't know anything
about our finances.

35
We're professors, Hannah. Professors.

36
We can't keep bankrolling
your groovy lifestyle.

37
My "groovy" lifestyle?

38
The bills add up.

39
We're covering your rent,
your insurance, your cell phone.

40
You said it was cheaper for you
if I was on the family plan.

41
Yeah.

42
May I get you more of anything?

43
No, she's fine.

44
- Delicious.
- Yeah.

45
This is nuts.

46
Tad, can you help me here?

47
I could be a drug addict.
Do you realize how lucky you are?

48
I mean, it doesn't have to be heroin.

49
It could be something
more insidious like pills,

50
which are legal,
and which a lot of kids do all the time.

51
And then slowly,
they become totally useless.

52
They seem really high-functioning,
and then it just ruins them.

53
Okay, my friend Sophie,
her parents don't support her.

54
Last summer,
she had two abortions right in a row,

55
and no one came with her.

56
What does that have to do with anything?

57
I'm just saying that
I am so close to the life that I want,

58
the life that you want for me,
that for you to just end that right now?

59
No more money.

60
- Starting when?
- Starting now.

61
We can talk about it tomorrow.

62
I don't want to see you tomorrow.

63
- What?
- But we fly our Tuesday.

64
I have work,
and then, I have a dinner thing,

65
and then I am busy
trying to become who I am.

66
Alarm.

67
What?

68
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

69
Miss? You are here.

70
Already?

71
Good morning, Charlie.

72
Why didn't you wake me up?

73
I didn't mean to sleep with Hannah.

74
Because you two looked so angelic.

75
Victoria's secret angel. Fat baby angel.

76
- Don't say that.
- No way. You look awesome these days.

77
Please avert your eyes.

78
Is that a present?

79
Is that for me?

80
- Give it here.
- Thank you.

81
You guys fell asleep
to Mary Tyler Moore again, huh?

82
Yes, guilty.

83
It's a very odd show
to hear through a wall.

84
Coming at you.

85
Here it comes.

86
I just blew up a kiss on you.

87
- Are you going to leave your towel on?
- Yes.

88
But I never see you naked,
and you always see me naked

89
when it should actually
be the other way around.

90
- You are beautiful. Shut up.
- I don't need that.

91
- I need to see your boobs.
- Well, you don't get to. Sorry.

92
I only show my boobs
to people I'm having sex with.

93
You literally slept
in my bed to avoid him.

94
I know.

95
Hannah, I’ve turned a corner.

96
His touch now feels like

97
a weird uncle just putting
his hand on my knee at Thanksgiving.

98
What are you going to do?

99
- I think I have to end it.
- You can't do that.

100
I have to. Why not?

101
'Cause he'll stand
outside our window with a boom box,

102
- or he'll kill himself.
- Stop.

103
Hey, babe.

104, Sorry. I thought it was
just my girlfriend in here.

105
Dude, it's never just
your girlfriend in here.

106
I'm just saying goodbye.

107
I'll see you ladies tonight,
and I'll pick up wine.

108
Okay, big kisses.

109
Bye.

110
What does it even feel like
to be loved that much?

111
I don't know. I can't feel it anymore.

112
Oh, no.

113
I know, I just...

114
And it makes me feel like such a bitch
'cause I can feel him being so nice to me,

115
and yet it makes me so angry.

116
I think you need
to admit something to yourself,

117
which is that you're sick
of eating him out.

118
'Cause he has a vagina.

119
- Hi.<i> Ca VA?</i>
-<i> Bonjour</i>, rookie.

120
Oh, my god. You're so hip, I could puke.

121
I can never pull off that hat.
How do you pull off that hat?

122
I love your jumper.

123
Your skin is, like, hauntingly beautiful.

124
- Can I put my bags down?
- What?

125
Oh, my god, of course.

126
You're like my favorite cousin.

127
I'm the only one of my girlfriends
that has a British cousin.

128
Well, how long do you think
you're going to stay for?

129
I mean, not that I'm asking you to leave.

130
You can totally stay forever
if you want to.

131
- Can I have something to eat?
- Yeah.

132
You've been interning there for a year.

133
You need to tell them
it's time to get paid.

134
Costs a lot of money to look this cheap.

135
This is not a joke. If you can't
afford to pay your half of the rent,

136
Charlie is going to move in here.

137
- You're dumping Charlie.
- I didn't say that.

138
So I texted Adam about tonight,
and I have not heard anything back.

139
Hannah, look at me.

140
He never, ever texts you back.

141
Maybe I should call him.

142
I mean, didn't you say texting's, like,
the lowest form of communication

143
- on the pillar of chat?
- The totem of chat.

144
And no, the lowest,
that would be Facebook,

145
followed by chat, then texting,

146
- then email, then phone.
- Got you.

147
Face-to-face is, of course, ideal.
But it's not of this time.

148
Okay, but then how am I
supposed to get him face-to-face

149
if he refuses to text me?

150
Think Jessa will really appreciate
the welcome-home dinner.

151
It's a very fiendish thing of us to do.

152
-What?
-I just know she's going to show up late,

153
wearing some fabulous blankety dress
from a Grecian marketplace and be like,

154
"Oh, I can't remember where I got this."

155
I'm really glad that she's coming home.

156
But every time she comes into town,

157
you go on some week-long bender,

158
and then, she leaves
to go off to her next country

159
and I'm left to pick up the pieces.

160
Okay, it is so rare that I say this,

161
but I just think she's fun.

162
Yeah, it was really fun
when she fucked Carolyn’s boyfriend.

163
She didn't fuck your boyfriend.

164
That's 'cause he was
in Prague that semester.

165
Thanks so much.

166
It's a great deal for Lolita.

167
I mean, 2,100 a month? Amaze.

168
It's a little more expensive
than the dorms,

169
but Aunt Ilene thinks
it's like the perfect bachelorette pad.

170
I mean...

171
Do you like the poster?

172
Oh, you know, I've never seen that movie.

173
- Only the show?
- Is it a show?

174
Oh, my god. You're not serious.

175
I mean, that's like not being on Facebook.

176
- I'm not on Facebook.
- You're so fucking classy.

177
You know, you're funny
because you're definitely like a Carrie

178
but with, like, some Samantha aspects
and Charlotte hair.

179
- That's like a perfect combination.
- Oh, thank you.

180
I think I'm definitely a Carrie at heart,

181
but, like, sometimes...

182
Sometimes, Samantha kind of comes out.

183
And then, I mean, when I’m at school,

184
I definitely try
and put on my Miranda hat.

185
Where were you before France?

186
Before France, I was in Amsterdam...

187
No, I was in Bali,

188
and I was shucking pearls there.

189
- And then, I met a surfer--
- Oh, my god. Did he really like you?

190
- He, like, really liked you, right?
- Yeah, he really liked me.

191
- Hannah?
- Hello, Alistair.

192
Hello.

193
You seem eager.

194
As you know,
I've been working here for over a year.

195
Has it been that long?

196
Well, you are an invaluable part
of our operation.

197
Which I recently learned means
very valuable

198
as opposed to not at all valuable.

199
And I wanted to let you know
that my circumstances have changed,

200
and I can no longer afford
to work for free.

201
Oh, Hannah.

202
I am so sorry to lose you.

203
I was just going
to start you manning our Twitter.

204
You have just the Quincy voice for that.

205
Oh, no, I'm not quitting.

206
I just... I know that Joy-Lynn
got hired after interning,

207
- so I thought that maybe--
- Hannah.

208
Joy-Lynn knows Photoshop.

209
Now, in this economy,

210
do you know how many
internship requests I get every day?

211
- I would assume a lot.
- Fifty. It's about 50.

212
I practically route them
into my spam folder.

213
So, if you think you have
just nothing left to learn from us...

214
No, it is not that, really.

215
I just, you know, got to eat.

216
Well, when you get hungry enough,

217
you're going to figure it out.

218
Do you mean, like,
physically hungry or hungry for the job?

219
I am really going to miss your energy.

220
I think this is going to be
perfect for you.

221
You mentioned that
when I was finished with my book,

222
I could send it to you.

223
Well, we wouldn't have you here
to read it for us, would we?

224
Where are you going?

225
Will you get me a Luna Bar?

226
And a Smart water and Vitamin water?

227
Yo, hey.

228
Yeah, no, I'm actually
just leaving a friend's house

229
that's, like, right by your house, so...

230
Yeah?

231
- Hey, doll.
- Hey.

232
"Doll," that is what my dad calls me.

233
Yeah, I know. He told me.
We're in the same circle jerk.

234
- I just had the worst every day.
- You were nearby?

235
Why?

236
I got fired from my job, so...

237
Weren't you an intern?

238
Well, I was working there for a while,

239
- so I was technically an intern.
- So basically,

240
they just asked you
to not hang out there anymore?

241
When I was walking over here...

242
Funny. I was on my way over here,
and I was panicking,

243
but then it occurred to me,
like, I'm an English major.

244
-There has to be some kind of--
- Major doesn't matter.

245
I was Comp Lit, and it hasn't done shit.

246
Yeah, but you're an actor, so aren't you
always comparing different literature?

247
I don't know.

248
Plus, I'm into this woodworking stuff.
It's just more honest.

249
Yeah, it all looks awesome.
But what about your play?

250
Yeah, we're not doing it.
That guy's a dick.

251
Can I sit down?

252
Yeah.

253
So, if I tell you something,
will you promise that you won't judge me?

254
Yes.

255
'Til yesterday, I got all
of my money from my parents.

256
Okay.

257
Does that make you feel sick?
Make you not want to talk to me?

258
No, I mean I wouldn't take shit
from my parents. They're buffoons.

259
But my grandma gives me
800 dollars a month.

260
So is that, like,
how you support yourself or...

261
Yeah. I mean, I supplement.

262
But it gives me the freedom
that I don't have to be anyone's slave.

263
You should never be
anyone's fucking slave,

264
except mine.

265
You're feeling pretty frisky.

266
I really despise that word.
I hate it so much.

267
I like you so much.
I don't know where you disappear to.

268
What are you talking about?
I'm right here.

269
It's so funny that it's still light out,

270
but it's getting dark
a lot earlier these days.

271
- Is this some of your poetry?
- Don't be a jerk.

272
Who, me?

273
Do you know that part on your résumé

274
where they ask you to list
all of your special skills?

275
I haven't applied for a job
in a long fucking time.

276
Okay, well, it's the thing
where they ask you to list, like,

277
yoga, Spanish, waterskiing, Photoshop.

278
I feel like I

279
don't have any special skills.

280
- I have something you can do.
- What?

281
But first, I have to see
if you fulfill all the requirements.

282
What are the requirements?

283
Lie on your stomach.

284
- Now?
- Yes, now. Wait.

285
You modern career woman,
I know what you like.

286
You think you can just come in here
and talk all that noise?

287
No?

288
Grab your legs.

289
- Just what did you say?
- Grab your legs.

290
Okay.

291
Okay, this is good.

292
- I'm going to go get some lube.
- Why do we need to get lube?

293
When I get back,
I want you in the exact same position,

294
but take all the rest of the shit off.

295
Will you get a condom?

296
I'll consider it.

297
Jesus fucking Christ.

298
This is really hard.

299
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

300
- You putting on a condom?
- No.

301
- Wait, you are, right?
- Yes.

302
Okay, 'cause when you said
the thing about lube,

303
I was worried you were going to try and

304
do that. Please don't do that.

305
That feels awful. Thank you.

306
- It's all right.
- Okay. Thank you.

307
That's the right spot.

308
Yeah, sorry.

309
So, I can just stay like this
for a little while?

310
Yeah.

311
- Do you need me to move more, or like...
- What?

312
I just didn't know
if you wanted me to be more, like...

313
-like that.
-Oh, no. This is fine. You're doing great.

314
This is all you need to do.

315
I'm sorry about the wrong hole thing.

316
I just... I don't want to do it now.

317
And, like, if we did,
I'd just want to talk about it

318
and just, like, figure out what...

319
- It's just not comfortable for me--
- Let's play the quiet game.

320
- So, you're not mad at me?
- No, I'm great.

321
Great time.

322
<i>You know what would be crazy?</i>

323
<i>- What would be crazy?</i>
<i>- Like if we...</i>

324
just got crazy right here, right now.

325
We could just do that.

326
I mean, nobody's stopping us.
Nobody's home.

327
What would turn you on the most right now?

328
What would turn me on the most?

329
What would turn you on the most?

330
To turn you on,
that's what would turn me on.

331
- Let me do that.
- Okay.

332
What if you were a stranger?

333
- Oh, yeah, a stranger.
- Right? What if...

334
What if you were just like
a totally different person?

335
You didn't act like you?

336
I think Jessa's here.

337
- Oh, no. I think that might be Ray.
- You invited Ray?

338
It was going to be
like a four-person party.

339
That's called dinner.

340
Gosh, I'm sorry.

341
What's with all the tattoos?

342
What do you mean?

343
Why'd you do all of them?

344
They're illustrations
from children's books mostly.

345
Even the one on your ass?

346
No. That one, my friend Jessa did
sophomore year with a safety pin.

347
It's a snake wrapped around the moon.

348
When did you do that?

349
I did them mostly in high school.

350
Why?

351
Truthfully? I gained
a bunch of weight very quickly,

352
and I just felt
very out of control of my own body,

353
and it was just like
right where I had the idea, like,

354
"I'm taking control of my own shape."

355
- You know, I was fat in high school.
- Really?

356
Yeah, but I didn't go
drawing all over myself.

357
You're not that fat anymore.
You can just have them lasered off.

358
What time is it?

359
Five o’clock.

360
What time is it?

361
Nine forty-five.

362
I am so late for this dinner thing.

363
Fuck.

364
Seriously, this was really, really nice.

365
It was perfect to see you.

366
I'm glad. Thanks for coming.

367
It made me feel a lot better, so...

368
I'll see you soon?

369
Yeah, just text me.

370
It's not like they're commandments,
but generally speaking,

371
as a general rule,
I try not to date women that are under 25

372
or that have been, at one point
in their life, penetrated by a drummer.

373
- One time!
- Guilty of both.

374
But I was walking
through the mall this morning,

375
I just see these two huge green orbs
bobbing through the mall.

376
I mean, look at these eyes!

377
- Have you seen these eyes?
- They're my eyes!

378
- He's so nice to me.
- Ridiculous.

379
Look at those lashes, too.
Have you seen these lashes?

380
- Guilty as charged.
- So cute.

381
- You okay?
- Yeah.

382
I just can't believe
Hannah didn't show up.

383
We're here. Living it up. Partying down.

384
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm just not really into eating this week.

385
Hannah was the one
saying this was our big reunion,

386
and now, she's nowhere to be found.

387
Are you worried?
I mean, should we call someone?

388
No, especially because
I know exactly where she is.

389
She's off having gross sex
with that animal.

390
In what way, gross?

391
Charlie would like
to at least hear about some sex.

392
Excuse me?

393
Ray's just being,
you know, like motivational.

394
I mean, come on, at least you didn't
have to entertain Jessa on her own.

395
Yeah, 'cause I didn't
get to entertain anybody

396
because no one came.

397
- Hannah! Marnie!
- Who's that? She sounds British.

398
Oh, I ordered a few hookers,
if you guys don't mind.

399
Bulgarian girls. Top-shelf.

400
- Nice girls.
- He kills me, I swear to god.

401
Marnie!

402
Top lock.

403
Paris is really where you should be.

404
If you're a Francophile like

405
- me and you, obviously.
- Yeah.

406
- Then, you've got to go to France.
- You have to go.

407
I was a live-in educator
for these three children,

408
and they all sang.

409
And their father
was a brilliant pacifist thinker.

410
Isn't that the plot to<i> The Sound of Music</i>?

411
- It is.
- We really want to travel more.

412–We could just go.
- Up and go.

413
I am so sorry I'm so late.

414
- Hannah banana.
- Would you please come here

415
- and talk to us?
- Hello.

416
You're here. Hi.

417
What's going on? You look beautiful.

418
- What'd you say?
- What's going on?

419
- She smells like sex.
- No, but you showered this morning.

420
So I calculated,
and I can last in New York

421
for three and a half more days.

422
Maybe seven if I don't eat lunch.

423
I'm going to find you a job
worthy of your talents.

424
Well, I appreciate that,

425
but I don't know how you're going
to find a job fast enough.

426
I'm going to have
to work at, like, McDonald's.

427
You're not going to work at McDonald's.

428
What's wrong with McDonald's?
You should work at McDonald's.

429
It's great. It's fucking incredible.

430
You know how many people
McDonald's feeds every day?

431
You know how many people
it employs around the world?

432
Plus, they make
an incredible product, okay?

433
It tastes tremendous.

434
It's affordable. It's fucking consistent.

435
I can walk into a McDonald's in Nigeria,

436
order Chicken McNuggets,

437
when I bite into it,
you know what it's going to taste like?

438
It's going to taste like home.

439
It doesn't mean I have to work there.
I went to college.

440
Yeah, I went to college too.
You know where it left me?

441
I have 50,000 dollars in student loans.

442
That's how deep in debt I am.

443
I'm sorry, but watching this,
it is like watching<i> Clueless</i>.

444
The movie or the TV show?

445
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing over there?

446
I'm making a little brew.

447
He's making a tea of opium pods.

448
Oh, cool. So you brought opium
into our apartment.

449
Well, yeah, this stuff's pretty mild.

450
This is much milder
than the stuff you'd smoke.

451
It's legal. I got it down
at the flower district.

452
You can just go there and buy the pods.

453
- Is it cool if I have a little?
- Knock yourself out.

454
- I hate opium.
- Oh, yeah, what's your thing? Coke?

455
No, I never do coke.

456
Every time I do coke, I shit my pants.

457
Oh, Jesus Christ.

458
- That's horrible.
- It happens.

459
- What does it taste like?
- It kind of tastes like twigs.

460
- Yeah, I'll have some.
- Maybe you shouldn't.

461
You're super sensitive to drugs.

462
I think I'm going to be fine, okay?
Hand it over.

463
It's hot.

464
Oh, Jesus.

465
This does not taste like Twix.

466
Not Twix. Twigs.

467
Twigs, like small sticks.

468
If you're going to vanish,
you have to call, okay?

469
Yeah, okay. I want to go back in there.

470
No, you can't.
I need to talk to you first.

471
All you need to do is
talk to your parents, okay?

472
You need to ask them to support you
for a little itty-bitty longer

473
just while you look for another job.

474
And tell them
that you take your future seriously.

475
Because you do. You're Hannah.

476
- Does Charlie have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

477
Marnie was just saying that she feels
like I need to go and talk to my parents

478
and ask them to support me
until I get a job.

479
Why don't you just tell them
that you're an artist?

480
You just need to tell them
once and for all

481
- that you are an artist.
- Just tell them

482
you're going to get a job,
that's much more convincing.

483
Tell them you'll get tuberculosis
in a garret if you have to.

484
Tell them it's what Flaubert did.

485
Flaubert is not a good role model.
And have you met her parents?

486
She can't just do the artist thing.

487
Tell them that Picasso did it.

488
Rappers who were poor
and sold their tapes in the street did it.

489
It's what Elvis did.
It's what Mick Jagger did.

490
It's what my stepbrother did.

491
They all stuck to their guns.

492
I need to go.

493
You just drank an entire cup of opium.

494
You are gorgeous and a vision.

495
You are a brilliant genius.

496
Both of you are sex goddesses.

497
When I look at both of you,
a Coldplay song plays in my heart.

498
Bye.

499
God, she seems like
she's in such a good place.

500
<i>Mom? Papa?</i>

501
- I think that's Hannah.
- Did she just call me papa?

502
- Hi!
- Oh, hey.

503
What the heck are you doing here?

504
I thought you didn't
want to see us anymore.

505
Actually, I couldn't bear the idea
of not seeing you before you left town.

506
But more important...
Here, you can sit down.

507
It's late. I'm sorry.

508
...is that I brought you my book.

509
I need you to read it.

510
Jesus, it's hot.

511
- Great. Yeah.
- That's fine.

512
Are you boiling?

513
Great, we'll read it on the plane.

514
No, now.
I need you to read it now because...

515
I don't want to freak you out,

516
but I think that I may be
the voice of my generation.

517
Or at least a voice

518
of a generation.

519
Well, just read.
Don't be scared. Just enjoy it

520
'cause there's going to be plenty
for us to talk about after.

521
Just go for it.

522
I need to talk to you.

523
All right.

524
I do not like
what just went down out there at all.

525
What, with Hannah?

526
Yeah, I guess I just don't
understand the problem.

527
- She seemed ready.
- She had just gotten high.

528
I'd like for you
to see a real high person.

529
Marnie, you can't mother her like that.

530
I'm not mothering her. I'm literally
preventing a disaster from happening.

531
Have you even read her novel?

532
It's a memoir, and of course
I've read it, I'm her best friend.

533
"Best friend. This is my best friend."

534
You know, we don't own anybody.

535
Maybe you don't respect
what the best friendship means

536
because you've never stayed
in one place long enough to have one.

537
Marnie, I can't help your feelings.

538
Maybe you can help to be two hours late

539
to a dinner party that was thrown for you.

540
- My god! Yes.
- It was two hours?

541
- When was dinner?
- Seven!

542
Seven? I thought
that was just a suggestion.

543
A smuggest... Okay, I'm sorry
we don't eat at one in the morning,

544
but we don't live in Barcelona.

545
Maybe not 1, but 10.

546
Ten’s reasonable.

547
See, this is what you do.

548
You act like I'm uptight,
and then I follow suit. I become uptight.

549
It is the most frustrating dynamic
on the planet.

550
- It drives me crazy. I can't stand it.
- I'm fucking pregnant.

551
All right? I'm pregnant.

552
- On purpose?
- What do you think?

553
I have to tell you something, you two.

554
You guys are so beautiful.

555
Okay, all right.

556
That's a high person.

557
- This is very funny stuff, Doreen.
- Yeah.

558
- Hannah, you're a very funny girl.
- Thank you, Papa.

559
- Okay.
- Oh.

560
All I am asking for to finish this book

561
is 1,100 dollars a month

562
for the next two years.

563
- That's a chunk of change.
- That's insane.

564
You would say it's insane.

565
Who can live in New York
on 1,100 dollars a month?

566
But I am so committed to this book

567
that I am willing
to get pretty thrifty on this.

568
Why don't you get a job and start a blog?

569
You are so spoiled.

570
Yeah, well, whose fault is that, Mom?

571
- Your father's.
- You know this is making me so unhappy.

572
- I'm having such a horrible feeling.
- Oh, we're not Amu, Hannah.

573
And the least you can do is
sit up straight and...

574
Hannah?

575
Hannah, Jesus. Hannah?

576
- I shouldn't have taken it,
- Taken?

577
- but I was just having such a bad day.
- Taken what? What did you take?

578
Is she sick, Tad?
Do I need to call a hospital?

579
I think she may be high.

580
- It's legal, like flowers.
- Oh, my god.

581
I'm not going to be angry, Hannah.
All right, I'm just really curious.

582
- What did you smoke?
- It's opium pods.

583
It's a tea of opium pods.

584–We should Google that.
- I don't need to Google that.

585
I know about that.
It's tantamount to smoke banana peels.

586
For Christ's sake,
let's just order her a coffee.

587
Coffee's for grown-ups.

588
You're going to drink
a strong cup of coffee!

589
I'm 24 years old!
Don't tell me what to do.

590
This is a real display.

591
No, this is the immediate result
of a cold approach.

592
You can't just pull the rug out

593
- from under her so suddenly.
- Why are you doing this?

594
We should stay a few more days.

595
Look, I admire your kind heart.
I really do.

596
But you're getting played
by a major fucking player!

597
I know! But it's hard
for me to watch her struggle!

598
My skirt feels so tight.

599
Maybe you can just cut it open
with scissors?

600
It's like watching her get a shot!

601
- Shots keep people from getting sick!
- Well...

602
- I want a lake house. I work hard.
- I know.

603
I want to sit by a fucking lake.

604
- You deserve a lake.
- I'm going to die

605
like Flaubert in a garret.

606
Don't look at me.

607
Mom?

608
Dad?

609
Hi, I'm in room 2507,
and I wanted to get some room service.

610
Oh.

611
But if the account is totally closed
if they've checked out,

612
you can't add anything?

613
Okay, no. Yeah, got it.

614
I'm leaving right now. Thank you.

615
Why don't you smile?

616
Does your heart hurt?

617
Oh, girl, when I look at you,
I just want to say,

618
"Hello, New York!"
